      <description>If you would like to create your free TLS certificates before you make your DNS change, you need to configure your server.
For users of Nginx   Obtain the CNAME record for your application. You&amp;rsquo;ll see this on the DNS menu in the Section management console.
  Add this block to your server&amp;rsquo;s configuration, replacing yourdomain.c.section.io with the CNAME you obtained above:
location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {proxy_set_header Host $host;proxy_pass http://yourdomain.</description>

      <description>Getting started Download or unzip the certificates in to a directory somewhere on your computer. The certificates should be PEM encoded and will look like the following in a text editor.
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/* contents of certificate */-----END CERTIFICATE----- You will require Openssl to be installed. To check if you have Openssl installed, open a command prompt and type:
openssl version You should see output like OpenSSL 1.</description>

      <description>Context If you wish to configure the Section platform to pass the ACME Challenge route through to your origin please follow the following steps. Please note that enabling this feature will render the Section provided Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt SSL certificates unusable.
Steps Follow the below steps to deploy this change:
 Locate the section.config.json file in the root of your Section git repository. Locate environment block (in this example we&amp;rsquo;ll be using Production).</description>

      <title>Set up HTTPS and HTTP/2</title>
      <link>https://www.section.io/docs/how-tos/application-edge-management/https-tls/setup-https/</link>

      <guid>https://www.section.io/docs/how-tos/application-edge-management/https-tls/setup-https/</guid>
      <description>When your application is first created it will be served over HTTP and via HTTPS using a default network certificate. Once we detect DNS has been changed on to our platform we will provide a signed and valid certificate through Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.
If you have added multiple domains to the application, a Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt certificate will be provided for each domain. If you have provided your own custom certificate, you need to upload a certificate for each domain (even if they are listed as alternate names on the same certificate) using our API.</description>
