      <description>If visitors, crawlers, or spammers are degrading the performance of your site, it may be appropriate to block these from accessing your website content.
Rather than letting these requests be processed by Section and your origin server, you can block them as they enter Section.
There are two approaches to Blocking IP&amp;rsquo;s.
 IP Restrictions screen in Aperture web dashboard section.config.json in Advanced Config &amp;amp; git workflow  The simplest interface to view/edit these values is available via &amp;ldquo;Configuration&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;IP Restrictions&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Change your Origin Address</title>
      <link>https://www.section.io/docs/how-tos/application-edge-management/account-configuration/change-origin/</link>

      <description>Section is a proxy service, so at the end of the day, any requests for your site that have not been offloaded by the cache or redirected or blocked by the firewall will be passed on to be served by your webserver. The address of this server (or the address of the load balancer in front of your servers) is the origin address.
When your first setup your site on Section we resolve the DNS of the hostname you enter and set that as the origin address.</description>

      <description>- www.example.com/admin/ - the admin-only site  - www.example.com/assets/ - static assets    - www.example.com/assets/images/ - static images only See the Split option under Overview for your application in Section Aperture for some more detail. A split application can later be [deleted](#deleting-applications) and requests for its URL prefix will resume being handled by the original application. All applications handling requests for a given domain must be within the same Section account.</description>

      <guid>https://www.section.io/docs/how-tos/application-edge-management/account-configuration/install-a-new-proxy/</guid>
      <description>The section.config.json file The config files dictates the order that traffic will flow through the proxy chain — be aware of the location you put the new reverse proxy in.
For example, if your application is setup with Varnish Cache 4.0.3, you should see this at the top of your config file:
&amp;quot;proxychain&amp;quot;: [ { &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;modsecurity&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;modsecurity:2.2.7&amp;quot; } ]  1) Add the proxy to your environment&amp;rsquo;s section.config.json file Let&amp;rsquo;s add Varnish Cache 6.</description>

      <description>The section.config.json file This file in the root of your git repository found under the Advanced config menu in Aperture, defined which proxies/modules are running for your environment dictated by the git branch.
For example, if your application is setup with Varnish Cache 6.1.1 and Kraken 2.0.0, you should see this at the top of your config file:
&amp;quot;proxychain&amp;quot;: [ { &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;varnish&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;varnish:6.1.1&amp;quot; }, { &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;kraken&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;kraken:2.</description>

      <title>Run multiple origins in one environment</title>

      <description>A Guide to hooking up multiple origin servers to one Section environment and orchestrating incoming HTTP traffic distribution among them. When you have a single origin or upstream server, your section.config.json file will look something like this:
&amp;quot;origin&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;address&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;origin.example.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;host_header&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;override.example.com&amp;quot;} However, there are cases where it is useful to have two different upstream services — perhaps you want to make two backend systems appear on the same domain.</description>

      <title>Set up Outage Pages</title>
      <link>https://www.section.io/docs/how-tos/application-edge-management/account-configuration/outage-pages/</link>

      <guid>https://www.section.io/docs/how-tos/application-edge-management/account-configuration/outage-pages/</guid>
      <description>A guide to setup custom outage pages Section has an Outage Page feature that will allow multiple HTML pages to be uploaded on to the platform and displayed during maintenance or other planned down times.
1) Design an outage page The Outage Page feature is designed for HTML only. We recommend keeping the HTML simple. Any static assets linked in the HTML should be hosted off domain, such as on AWS S3.</description>

      <title>Whitelist Section traffic to origin infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://www.section.io/docs/how-tos/application-edge-management/account-configuration/whitelist-section-traffic-on-origin/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.section.io/docs/how-tos/application-edge-management/account-configuration/whitelist-section-traffic-on-origin/</guid>
      <description>Overview Section&amp;rsquo;s platform runs on a multitude of hosting providers which means we do not provide a static set of IP addresses. This can be a problem if you wish to whitelist Section traffic to your origin infrastructure.
Alternative method If you wish to whitelist our servers we suggest using a shared secret key header that is send by Section&amp;rsquo;s platform as part of all requests to the origin, and the origin can choose to block requests that do not have that header present.</description>
