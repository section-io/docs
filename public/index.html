All of the files in your repository can be accessed by visiting Advanced Config under the Application Edge menu in the left nav of Aperture. For more information on more basic configurations done through our GUI, check out quick configuration.\nIn the repository you can see all the files in your repository, commits to those files, stats, and a branching diagram. All of your advanced configuration for any of your reverse proxies will be done by editing the files here.\nInside Advanced Config, you should see one folder for every reverse proxy running on your application and one \u0026lsquo;section.config.json\u0026rsquo; file, where you can add additional reverse proxies to your stack. If you want to add a new reverse proxy your stack, check out our guide.\nWorking locally Because your Section configuration is a git repository, you can also clone it locally to work with as well as using the web editor. This is particularly helpful if you want to do local development with our Developer POP.\nCopy the URL from the Advanced Config page labelled Clone with HTTPS and use this to run git clone \u0026lt;url-from-advanced-config\u0026gt;.\nGit Authentication There are two ways to authenticate git:\n If you log into Aperture with a username \u0026amp; password you can just use those credentials to also authenticate git. If you access Aperture via SSO, or you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use your main credentials for git, you can also authenticate with an API Token. If you don\u0026rsquo;t already have an API token, follow these instructions to create one. Once that is done you can authenticate git using section-token as the username and the API Token value as the password.  </p>",

XSS attacks exploit the browser\u0026rsquo;s trust of the content received from the server. Malicious scripts are executed by the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser because the browser trusts the source of the content, even when it\u0026rsquo;s not coming from where it seems to be coming from.\n  CSP makes it possible for server administrators to reduce or eliminate the vectors by which XSS can occur by specifying the domains that the browser should consider to be valid sources of executable scripts.\n The CSP Report module allows users to easily insert and modify security policies and track which part of a site\/application has experienced policy breaches.\n </p><p>CSP,</p><p>content,</p><p>security,</p><p>policy,</p><p>XSS,</p><p>injection</p>",

							value: "ModSecurity",
							label: "<p>Modsecurity Configuration The initial configuration in a repository starts ModSecurity’s SecRuleEngine in DetectionOnly mode (this writes log entries but never executes any disruptive actions) with rules from base_rules \u0026amp; optional_rules. This is a great starting point, as you can immediately see possible threats without stopping legitimate traffic to your site.\nNote: Whilst many tutorials and guides use Symbolic Links to have content appear in the rules\/activated_rules directory, symbolic links complicate the use of source control \u0026amp; local development. It is recommended to copy files instead, and never use symbolic links in any Section configuration.\nTo add a new rule set, copy the rule set .conf file into your rules\/activated_rules directory.\nTo remove a rule set, delete the corresponding .conf file from your rules\/activated_rules directory.\nTo edit a rule set, edit the text content of the corresponding .conf in your rules\/activated_rules directory.\nThere is also a GUI tool under Configuration\u0026gt;Proxy in the application portal to help enable and disable rule sets.\nFor documentation see Modsecurity and OWASP Modsecurity Rule Set Project.\nHow ModSecurity work on Section At every opportunity, the implementation of ModSecurity on the Section platform has been designed to be as close as possible to how it would be if you had installed ModSecurity yourself locally.\nSection uses the official ModSecurity distributions published by [Trustwave] running upon Apache. Section does not use custom-compiled builds of modsecurity.\nModSecurity will be initialized with the configuration found in the modsecurity.conf file, and matching rule files at rules\/activated_rules\/*.conf under the corresponding subdirectory of your Section application repository.\nNote: Like other proxies in Section, ModSecurity will sit between a TLS offload system accepting incoming connections, and an outbound proxy making upstream connections. Two additional HTTP request headers will be added to carry connection information, X-Forwarded-For containing the downstream client IP address and any intermediate proxy IP addresses, and also X-Forwarded-Proto which will specify either http or https depending on the protocol with which the downstream client connected.\nHigh Availability \u0026amp; ModSecurity State To achieve high availability \u0026amp; performance in production, Section will run multiple instances of your ModSecurity proxy stack. It’s important to consider that each instance is unaware of the internal state of other running instances.\nA set of client requests will likely be spread across different instances, and any rules that track state (using setvar, setuid, setsid, etc) will likely act differently in a distributed environment.\nEnabling Protection Every rule set can have false positives in new environments and any new installation should initially run with Detection only. After running ModSecurity in detection only mode for a while, review the logs and decide if any further modifications to the rule sets should be made before switching to protection mode.\nTo enabled protection edit the modsecurity.conf file and change the setting for SecRuleEngine from DetectionOnly to On.\nAvailable versions ModSecurity 2.7  apache 2.4.7 modsecurity 2.7.7 OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set ([commit c63affc9dfa6294ecf8782ae4d1f1fb2c9fd5a18]) included by default  </p><p>Modsecurity</p><p>firewall</p>",

This tutorial assumes you\u0026rsquo;ve cloned your application\u0026rsquo;s git repository to your local machine.\nStep 1 - Updating section.config.json  Add the following object to your proxystack array in your section.config.json file located in the root of your repository.  { \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;consistenthash\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;image\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;consistenthash:1.0.0\u0026quot; }  Typically this is added downstream of the module you want to load balance traffic to based on the consistent hash.\n Step 2 - Adding default files  Create a consistenthash directory in the root of your repository. Create the following files under the consistenthash directory:  server.conf    Step 3 - Populate the server.conf file The server.conf file contents:\n# Use HTTP 1.1 to allow for keepalive connections proxy_http_version 1.1; # Pass the request host header through to the upstream proxy_set_header Host $host; # Allow http connections to be kept open proxy_set_header Connection \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; # Pass the origin server response header through rather than allowing nginx to set it to \u0026#34;nginx\u0026#34; proxy_pass_header Server; location \/ { proxy_pass \u0026#34;http:\/\/consistenthash_uri_next_hop_upstream\u0026#34;; } This default config implements the consistent hash based on the URI path of the HTTP request in the proxy_pass directive, but you can use the following values for other forms of consistent hashing:\n consistenthash_uri_next_hop_upstream - consistent hash based on the URI path. consistenthash_client_ip_next_hop_upstream - consistent hash based on the originating Client IP address. next_hop_upstream - no consistent hashing applied.

							value: "Understanding Cache Effectiveness",
							label: "<p>Whenever a request reaches a Varnish Cache instance, one of four outcomes occurs: hit, miss, pass, or synth.\nA key metric when evaluating website performance is cache hit rate. Cache hit rate is a measure of how effectively the cache is responding to customer requests.\nA hit means that the cache responded to the request with a cached resource.\nA miss means that the cache tried to respond to the request with a cached resource but could not do so because it did not have a copy of the requested resource in its memory.\nA pass means that the cache did not even try to look up a response for the requested resource — often users specifically instruct Varnish Cache to pass on urls that should never be served from cache like \/checkout, but there are other causes as well.\nFrom a performance standpoint, the goal is to increase Hit % and decrease Miss and Pass %.\nWhy do you care?:\nWhenever the cache answers a customer request, that means the request did not need to be answered by your website origin server. Having a large percentage of cache hits results in performance benefits and reduced costs.\nFrom a performance standpoint, Varnish Cache\u0026rsquo;s quick lookup and response time combined with the geographic distribution of Section\u0026rsquo;s platform means that your users are quickly served a response from a server close to their geographical location.\nThis improves time-to-first-byte and keeps latency low.\nFrom a cost-savings perspective, every request that receives a response from cache does not need to connect to your origin server, greatly reducing load. With a finely-tuned caching configuration, your origin only needs to respond to requests for personalized actions such as checkout and and account pages.\nHow do you see it?:\nThis is the first chart we show you on the Section dashboard. To see this in action on our demo bootcamp application, go to Section Bootcamp Overview dashboard.\n  For more detailed information, such as the absolute number of requests and size of those requests, you can view Trending Metrics.

Section does not use custom-compiled builds of Varnish Cache.\nVarnish Cache is started, listening on port 80.\nVarnish Cache VCL can found in the default.vcl file in the corresponding subdirectory of your Section application repository.\nAssuming Varnish Cache is the first proxy in your proxy stack, Varnish Cache will receive connections from the Section TLS Offload Proxy with two additional HTTP request headers.\n X-Forwarded-For containing the downstream client IP address and any intermediate proxy IP addresses. X-Forwarded-Proto which will specify either HTTP or HTTPS depending on the protocol with which the downstream client connected.  Issuing cache invalidation requests to Varnish Cache sends a ban command to the Varnish Cache management interface. Section accepts any valid Ban expression and passes it to Varnish Cache unaltered.\nWe also provide some convenience tools to help with removing particular URL\u0026rsquo;s from the cache, see our Cache Clearing documentation for more details.\nRequesting the Varnish Cache Log executes varnishlog for each Varnish Cache instance and returns the results.\nvarnishncsa is also running, logging request and response details, including cache effectiveness. This data is used to drive the charts seen in Aperture.\nFundamentals  Varnish Cache is a HTTP caching reverse proxy. \u0026ldquo;Varnish Cache decides whether it can store the content or not based on the response it gets back from the backend\u0026rdquo;. the origin or backend can instruct Varnish Cache to cache the content with the HTTP response header Cache-Control. Varnish Cache by default does not cache cookies or other sensitive client side content. Varnish Cache has a conservative approach to caching to avoid the cache leaking sensitive data i.e. shopping cart or personalization information. Varnish Cache policies can be changed by Varnish Configuration Language (VCL). VCL is a flexible and power language that can handle a wide range of use cases. delivery from cache is usually in milliseconds. Varnish Cache is highly performant, is usually twice as fast as a backend server and Varnish Cache is usually constrained by networks.  Source: Varnish 6.3 Official Docs - Starting Varnish\nVarnish Cache Basics The Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) is a domain-specific language for caching HTTP requests. The language is specific to the domain of caching HTTP requests and responses.\n Varnish Configuration Language (VCL) implements a state machine. Varnish Cache uses VCL (Varnish Configuration Language) to run as a ‘state machine’. Various Varnish Cache states are thought of, and implemented as subroutines. Varnish Cache includes built-in subroutines via builtin.vcl. VCL has functions, legal return actions and variables. VCL functions can be extended by vmods (Varnish Cache modifications). Varnish Cache on Section has a preinstalled set of vmods. Each URL in the cache is hashed and accessible via a hash key based on host-headers, IP or other criteria via VCL logic or VMODs.  Varnish Cache Receive and Respond The two most important Varnish states or subroutines or subs are \u0026ldquo;received request\u0026rdquo;vcl_recv and \u0026ldquo;backend response\u0026rdquo; vcl_backend_response.\n \u0026ldquo;received request\u0026rdquo; vcl_recv \u0026ldquo;backend response\u0026rdquo; vcl_backend_response  Varnish Cache Flow Source: Varnish Software Book\nVarnish Cache Flow Described Each HTTP request flows by switching between Varnish Cache states such as recv, hit, miss or pass by calling return functions which use VCL logic to determine which state is next. For each state recv there is a VCL subroutine vcl_recv.\n   State Subroutine Name Description     recv vcl_recv Received HTTP request is completely received, parsed and can then be inspected and modified by this routine. vcl_recv subroutine is terminated by calling return() and can fail, synth, restart, pass, pipe, hash, purge and vcl(label).   hash vcl_hash Hash Creates a unique hash key for each cached object. By default, the builtin vcl_hash uses hostname or IP address and adds the requested URL to the cache hash. vcl_hash always runs the lookup action on the hash key and determines the next state \/ sub-routine i.e. hit, miss, pass or purge etc.   hit vcl_hit Hit Called by vcl_hash via the lookup operation, vcl_hit finds or \u0026ldquo;hits\u0026rdquo; a cache object. High hit rates are optimal for website performance.   miss vcl_miss Miss If a requested object is not found by a lookup of the cache hash key, it is declared a miss by the vcl_miss subroutine. vcl_miss decides if a document should be retrieved from a backend by returning fetch.   pass vcl_pass Pass \u0026ldquo;Called upon entering pass mode. In this mode, the request is passed on to the backend, and the backend\u0026rsquo;s response is passed on to the client, but is not entered into the cache. Subsequent requests submitted over the same client connection are handled normally\u0026rdquo;.   pipe vcl_pipe Pipe Pipes a HTTP request direct to backend or origin, passing back and forwards with no other VCL running. Basically turns Varnish into a dump TCP\/IP proxy.   fetch vcl_backend_fetch Backend Fetch vcl_backend_fetch can be called from vcl_miss or vcl_pass. It typically alters the request before it gets to the backend or origin.   response vcl_backend_response Backend Response vcl_backend_response is designed to avoid caching cookies and other probably undesired data. Called after response headers are retrieved from the backend\/origin. Returns vcl_deliver.   deliver vcl_deliver Deliver Usually the last exit point for HTTP request flows and is often used to add or remove debug-headers. Cached content is ready to be delivered to client of user.   synth vcl_synth Synth vcl_synth is called to deliver a synthetic object, generated in VCL and not fetched from the backend.    Varnish Cache Modifications Varnish Cache modifications or vmods pre-installed on Section. This is a collection of modules (\u0026ldquo;vmods\u0026rdquo;) extending Varnish VCL used for describing HTTP request\/response policies with additional capabilities.\n   VMOD Name Description     cookie Cookie HTTP request is received and can then be inspected and modified by this routine.   vsthrottle Throttling VMOD A Varnish Cache vmod for rate-limiting traffic on a single Varnish Cache server. Offers a simple interface for throttling traffic on a per-key basis to a specific request rate.   header Header VMOD for Varnish Cache Varnish Cahce Module for manipulation of duplicated HTTP headers, for instance multiple Set-Cookie headers.   saintmode Saint mode backend director Saintmode lets you deal with a backend that is failing in random ways for specific requests. It maintains a blacklist per backend, marking the backend as sick for specific objects. When the number of objects marked as sick for a backend reaches a set threshold, the backend is considered sick for all requests. Each blacklisted object carries a TTL, which denotes the time it will stay blacklisted.   softpurge Softpurge Softpurge is cache invalidation in Varnish that reduces TTL but keeps the grace value of a resource. It is not safe to use with Varnish Cache 5.0 onwards, use vmod-purge from Varnish Cache 5.2 instead.   tcp TCP vmod The TCP vmod opens for access and modification of client TCP connection attributes from VCL.   var var This VMOD implements basic variable support in VCL.   xkey xkey - Surrogate keys support for Varnish Cache This vmod adds secondary hashes to objects, allowing fast purging on all objects with this hash key.   bodyaccess Body access Undocumented VMOD giving access to body objects.    Builtin VCL  The built-in standard Varnish builtin.vcl   \u0026ldquo;Make sure you understand this: Your own VCL-configuration will not overwrite this builtin configuration, it will just be prepended to each sub. Unless your VCL code executes a terminating statement (e.g. return(pass)) it will continue into these default subs.\u0026rdquo;\n Source: Varnish Examples\nVarnish Cache Resources  Varnish Software Book: Intro Varnish Blog Varnish Latest Official Docs Varnish Source Code Varnish modifications  This document is inspired by Integralist\nAvailable versions Varnish Cache v6.0  Varnish Cache 6.0.0 Std VMOD - https:\/\/www.varnish-cache.org\/docs\/6.0\/reference\/vmod_std.generated.html Cookie, Header, Softpurge, Var, and Xkey VMODs - https:\/\/github.com\/varnish\/varnish-modules#readme  Varnish Cache v5.2  Varnish Cache 5.2.1 Std VMOD - https:\/\/www.varnish-cache.org\/docs\/5.2\/reference\/vmod_std.generated.html Cookie, Header, Softpurge, Var, and Xkey VMODs - https:\/\/github.com\/varnish\/varnish-modules#readme UUID VMOD - https:\/\/github.com\/Sharecare\/libvmod-uuid#readme  Varnish Cache v5.1  Varnish Cache 5.1.3 Std VMOD - https:\/\/www.varnish-cache.org\/docs\/5.1\/reference\/vmod_std.generated.html Cookie, Header, Softpurge, Var, and Xkey VMODs - https:\/\/github.com\/varnish\/varnish-modules#readme UUID VMOD - https:\/\/github.com\/Sharecare\/libvmod-uuid#readme  Varnish Cache v4.1 Varnish Cache 4.1 is available if you need this version\n Varnish Cache 4.1.9 Std VMOD - https:\/\/www.varnish-cache.org\/docs\/4.1\/reference\/vmod_std.generated.html Cookie, Header, Softpurge, Var, and Xkey VMODs - https:\/\/github.com\/varnish\/varnish-modules#readme UUID VMOD - https:\/\/github.com\/Sharecare\/libvmod-uuid#readme  Varnish Cache v4.0 Varnish Cache 4.0 is available if you need this version\n Varnish Cache 4.0.3 Std VMOD - https:\/\/www.varnish-cache.org\/docs\/4.0\/reference\/vmod_std.generated.html Cookie VMOD - https:\/\/www.varnish-cache.org\/vmod\/cookie Maxmind GeoIP VMOD - https:\/\/www.varnish-cache.org\/vmod\/maxmind-geoip Header VMOD - https:\/\/www.varnish-cache.org\/vmod\/header-manipulation UUID VMOD - https:\/\/github.com\/Sharecare\/libvmod-uuid#readme  Varnish Cache v3 If you have a need to run Varnish Cache 3, eg. you have existing v3 VCL you want to run in Section, pick this one.

You’ll need Node.js version 10.14 or later. You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.  If you are on Windows, we recommend downloading Git for Windows and use Git Bash that comes with it, which supports the UNIX-specific commands in this tutorial.\nSet up a demo app To set up a demo app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/section\/nodejs-example Run the development server You now have a new directory called nodejs-example. Let’s cd into it:\ncd nodejs-example Pull down the dependencies and build your app by running:\nnpm install npm run-script build  The Section platform expects you have run both of these commands before you can deploy your app. You must use npm as yarn is unsupported for now.\n Then, run the following command:\nnpm run-script start This starts your app’s development server on port 8080.\nLet’s check to see if it’s working. Open http:\/\/localhost:8080 from your browser.\nYour app is now ready to deploy Next: deploy your Node.js app.\nNode.js Edge App Hosting is a new Section product, so it may have some rough edges.

This tutorial assumes you\u0026rsquo;ve cloned your application\u0026rsquo;s git repository to your local machine.\nStep 1 - Setup Openresty in your proxy stack Follow the instructions from this page for more details\nStep 2 - Add CSP Report to Openresty  Create a folder under the openresty folder called csp, then copy the files from this Git Repository into the new folder. You should end up with the following files in your Section repository.  \/openresty\/csp\/csp.json \/openresty\/csp\/csp.lua \/openresty\/csp\/csp_init.lua Add the following line to Openresty\u0026rsquo;s init.lua file  cspInit = require(\u0026quot;\/opt\/proxy_config\/csp\/csp_init\u0026quot;) Use the following location blocks in Openresty\u0026rsquo;s server.conf file  location = \/.well-known\/csp_reporting { rewrite_by_lua_block { csp.respondToReport() } } location \/ { header_filter_by_lua_block { csp.injectHeader() } proxy_pass \u0026#34;http:\/\/next_hop_upstream\u0026#34;; } Step 3 - Configure the JSON file Edit \/openresty\/csp\/csp.json which should look like the following:\n{ \u0026#34;Content_Security_Policy_Report_Only\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;Insert policy here\u0026gt; report-uri https:\/\/www.yoursite.com\/.well-known\/csp_reporting\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inject_headers\u0026#34;: true } and populate the Content_Security_Policy_Report_Only property with your desired CSP policy. Make sure the report-uri is updated to use the domain on which this module is setup.\nThe inject_headers boolean is used to toggle whether the Content_Security_Policy_Report_Only property is injected as a Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only HTTP response header to all responses. You can set this to false to disable the injection.\nStep 4 - Deploy Commit your changes and push them to the desired branch you are working on.

While it is totally possible to skip this step, click through this warning and test your site without a problem, our Dev PoP can provision a certificate for your local cluster. On the top right hand side, click on the download root certificate button.\n  Download Local Root Certificate   a) For Windows Right click on the section.io-developer-pop-root certificate in your downloads folder and select install certificate. Click through the wizard and install the certificate. Once installed, you should see the DO_NOT_TRUST_sectionio_root in the security tab of your browser dev tools.\nb) For Mac Double-click on the certificate in your downloads folder and add it to the appropriate keychain. Once completed, you should be able to see DO_NOT_TRUST_sectionio_root under Category certificates. Right click on the certificate and select Get Info. Under the Trust section select the option Always Trust for When using this certificate. As with Windows, once installed properly the DO_NOT_TRUST_sectionio_root should appear in the security section of dev tools.\n3. Making changes to your configuration Now that you have traffic flowing through the Dev PoP you will be able to change any configuration and see it live within a few seconds.\nUsing your favorite editor, open the repository you cloned from Aperture. Whether you have Varnish, PageSpeed, or a Web Application Firewall, you can change the configuration to see how your application will behave.\nOnce you have made changes to your config, you will want to push them to the Dev PoP to see them in action.

							value: "Set up a Magento 2 app on Section",
							label: "<p>The following is a guide to going live on Section with a Magento 2 application.\n1) Download the Section extension. a) Via the Magento Marketplace To get started with Section and Varnish Cache directly from the Magento Admin portal, you first must download the \u0026ldquo;Instant Global Cache\u0026rdquo; extension from the Magento Marketplace.\nb) Via the command line Add \u0026quot;sectionio\/metrics\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;dev-master\u0026quot; to your composer.json file and run composer update. This assumes that your application is configured to pull from Packagist.\n2) Connect your Magento application to your Section account. Once the extension is added, click on Reports in the left Nav. A Section option should now be listed among your reports.\n  a) Set up via the Admin portal Inside the Section reports view, you will see fields requesting your Section credentials. If you\u0026rsquo;ve already created an account on our platform, enter those credentials here. Othewise, You can also create an account from here in the Magento portal or on our website: [section.io\/sign-up\/] (https:\/\/www.section.io\/sign-up\/). When you create your login, we will also send you an email to verify your email address. This is required for us to setup your application.\nb) Set up via the command line In order to link your Section account to your Magento application via the command line, you need to have already created an account( section.io\/sign-up\/). Once your account is created and the Section extension is installed inside your app, your magento binary should have access to the sectionio:setup command. From the root of your application, run bin\/magento sectionio:setup \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; \u0026lt;password\u0026gt; \u0026lt;account_id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;application_id\u0026gt;. A successful execution produces no output. If it executed successfully, you should see your account information displayed in the Section reports tab within your admin portal. Note: After running this command, run bin\/magento setup:upgrade and bin\/magento setup:di:compile.\n3) Set up your application and Varnish Cache . When you are logged in on your Magento Admin Portal with your Section credentials, we will determine if you already have an application setup with us. If you do, we will show you the accounts you have with us. If you do not, we will create an application for you.\nIf you do not have Varnish Cache as your chosen Full Page Cache Caching Application, we will show an error message for you to update this. To update this field, go to Stores -\u0026gt; Configuration (under Settings) -\u0026gt; Advanced -\u0026gt; System. Then toggle the Caching Application under Full Page Cache to Varnish Cache .\n  Now you have a Section application created with Varnish Cache 4 and Varnish Cache setup as your Full Page Cache solution in Magento.\n4) Import Magento Varnish Cache configuration a) Import via the Admin portal On the Section extension, you will see a Management section. The first button says “Update Varnish Cache configuration.” Clicking this button will pull in the recommended Magento VCL (Varnish Cache Configuration Language) into your Section application to optimize your caching for Magento.\n  b) Import via the command line You can also import your vcl configuration using the bin\/magento sectionio:updatevcl command. The effect of this is identical to the \u0026ldquo;Update Varnish Cache configuration\u0026rdquo; button described above. As with the other CLI commands, success is silent.\n5) Provision a free Section certificate (optional) There is also a button to pull in free HTTPS certificate. This will ensure your website has the green padlock next to the url. This is a free certificate included with your Section application that we will managed on your behalf, to include procurement, installation, and renewal. Please ensure your website has an endpoint exposed to the internet so we can validate the certificate before you go live.\nnote: if you do not perform this step, you will need to upload a custom certificate to the Section portal in order to maintain HTTPS. (See our guide )\n6) Change DNS and Go Live! To go live with Varnish Cache and your Section application, you will need to change a DNS record to point to Section. Detailed instructions can be found here. You can also find more information from your hosting provider as to where to go to make this change. Once you have made the change, you can click verify to see if the change was successful and traffic is currently flowing through Section.\nAdditional Settings: Include CMS in Product Purges When a product is updated either via checkout event, image update, description change or other similar event, Magento clears the cache for all pages where that product is mentioned, including the home page, category pages, and product pages. Although it is important to clear cache when product information changes, often this internal cache-clearing protocol clears the cache on non-product pages unnecessarily, exposing your origin to additional traffic and slowing down response times.\nAlthough the Section Magento extension forwards all cache-clearing directives to your cloud Varnish Cache instances out of the box, it can be configured to ignore cache clear requests for CMS pages. To enable this feature, navigate to Stores-\u0026gt;Configuration-\u0026gt;Advanced-\u0026gt;System-\u0026gt;Full Page Cache-\u0026gt;Section settings. Here you can toggle whether CMS pages are included in automated cache purges.\nNote: enabling this feature means that if you change key elements of a product like the name, other pages that feature the product will need to be manually cleared. Overall, this configuration option will have a positive benefit on site performance at the cost of some manual overhead. Whenever you update a product, you need to clear the relevant caches in the admin console.\n</p><p>cache,</p><p>https,</p><p>website</p><p>performance,</p><p>page</p><p>speed,</p><p>webpage</p><p>speed,</p><p>website</p><p>security,</p><p>content</p><p>delivery</p><p>network,</p><p>CDN</p>",

We are also compatible with Drush but it is not required.\n  You also need to enable a way to process cache invalidation items. You choices are the Cron processor and the Late runtime processor.The Cron Processor will process cache invalidations only when the cronjob is run (it runs automatically on a predefined schedule or you can initiate it manually from the admin console), while the Late runtime processor will process the purge queue when a page is requested. It does not matter to our module whether you choose either or both, however in production environments, you should only be using cron as there would be a significant page load time increase with the late runtime processor as it would need to make an api request every time a purge is in the queue, and if the request times out the end-user may get a 500 internal server error thrown by Drupal.\n  Finally, enable the Section Purger module and the Core Tags Queuer. This module ensures that Drupal sends the appropriate cache tags that our module uses to evict expired assets from the cache.\n  Safely store your Aperture Password with the key module Navigate to \/admin\/config\/system\/keys\/add and input your section.io password. Use key type Authentication, and choose whichever key provider you find to be the safest in your particular environment. (More info on this in the key module documentation).\n  Configure Full Page Cache Max Age Navigate to \/admin\/config\/development\/performance and set Page Cache Max Age to whatever value you prefer. Since the extension is clearing the cache whenever a change event occurs, there is no need to wait for object resources to expire naturally and you can safely choose 1 year. Varnish Cache\u0026rsquo;s default behavior is to cache according to the cache-control headers on the response, but Varnish Cache can also be configured to set its own internal TTL value for cached objects based on content-type, status, or other response attributes. For more information on this, please see our Varnish Cache guides.\nEnable the Section Purger within the Purge UI Navigate to \/admin\/config\/development\/performance. If your installation of the purge module succeeded, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a Purge tab next to the Performance tab at the top of the page.\nNext, click on Add Purger to open the UI to create a new Purger and select Section Bundled Purger. Once created, you should see a flash message informing you that the purger has been successfully created. The Section Bundled Purger combines API requests for tags, which reduces processing time on the origin, and potentially page load time if you are using the late runtime processor (cron is best for production environments).\n  Next, click on the small arrow next to the purger and click configure. This will open the UI to fill in your account credentials and connect your Drupal module to the Section platform.\nNote: The Drupal Site Name field should be the full hostname of the site for which you are configuring the purger, and is only necessary when setting up a Drupal 8 multisite. If your Drupal instance is not a multi-site, then this field can be left blank. Note: Varnish Proxy Instance Name field will usually be varnish. This name is defined in the section config in your application\u0026rsquo;s repository. This is useful if, for example you have multiple varnish instances that handle different things. You can set up a purger for each instance of varnish (if using Drupal site name, this would be per-instance and per-site-name)\nOnce here, input the details of the user account you would like to use to authenticate with our API. Once done, click Save Configuration. Once saved and configured properly, the status bar on the right hand side should show all green as pictured below.\n    Check the logs to confirm that queuer is working (optional) You can set the logging levels from the block on the right sidebar on the purge page.\n(\/admin\/config\/development\/performance\/purge)\n  You can view the logs at \/admin\/reports\/dblog\n  Raise the timeout if necessary If you are seeing timeout errors connecting to aperture, raise the timeout in the purger settings. We recommend a timeout of 2, but feel free to increase this to 5 when using the cron processor.\n  </p><p>cache,</p><p>website</p><p>performance,</p><p>page</p><p>speed,</p><p>webpage</p><p>speed,</p><p>Drupal</p>",

							label: "<p>Time To First Byte (TTFB) Time To First Byte is an important metric for user experience as people do not wait for slow pages to load.\n TTFB is a metric of the time taken for a user to receive the first byte. Start render time is crucial because it represents the time the user is waiting while looking at a blank screen. There is a high correlation between start render time and bounce rate, so significantly improving this metric has tangible business benefits.  HTML Streaming HTML Streaming uses Varnish ESI and OpenResty to punch a hole in the HTML DOM and can stream the HTML behind the title tag, but allows the loading and caching of the head of the document.\nDynamically cache parts of HTML document without caching elements of the page that are unique to the user. HTML streaming improves load time metrics and user experience without requiring complex application changes. Achieves faster page load times. HTML streaming dramatically improves the start render time on applications that are not yet caching their entire HTML document. Unlike dynamic content caching, HTML streaming does not require an intensive implementation time or code changes to your origin and can very quickly realize most of the gains of dynamic content caching within hours of enabling the feature with the help of Section\u0026rsquo;s engineers. HTML Streaming is fast to implement because it does not require changes to your origin and you don’t need to learn more advanced caching strategies or advanced VCL.  Before Section HTML Streaming Using a standard store and testing from Sydney Australia.\nBefore HTML Streaming is enabled TTFB is approximately 1500ms on the homepage of a Bigcommerce site using the permanent URL.\nAfter Section HTML Streaming After HTML Streaming and caching is enabled TTFB is approximately 190ms on the homepage.\nAfter Section caching and HTML Streaming is enabled, from Australia, we generally see an approximately 80-90% improvement in TTFB.\n </p><p>TTFB,</p><p>bigcommerce,</p><p>cache,</p><p>https,</p><p>website</p><p>performance,</p><p>page</p><p>speed,</p><p>webpage</p><p>speed,</p><p>website</p><p>security,</p><p>content</p><p>delivery</p><p>network,</p><p>CDN</p>",

Support is instead provided by the [free Turpentine Magento extension].\nThe Turpentine extension issues commands required for correct operation to a management port intended for Varnish Cache. A special “bridge” program listens on this port, and makes the Section platform look like a normal Varnish Cache instance (Instead of a globally distributed platform that runs Varnish Cache for you).\nFollow the official instructions in order to install Turpentine. Since Varnish Cache itself is already configured inside Section you’ll only need to complete the ‘Install this plugin’ steps.\n Sign up \u0026amp; create an application at Section using the final DNS name that your site will be accessed as. Download, install \u0026amp; configure the varnish-cli-bridge. Follow the standard Magento\u002bTurpentine instructions, with some exceptions (see below). Apply the Varnish Cache configuration from within Turpentine Configuration, to update Section. Update your public DNS records to direct traffic to Section for your site.   Create an application Section provides a customized Varnish Cache image already configured for Magento Turpentine. Create your application using the Stack “Varnish Cache v3 Magento Turpentine”.\n Set up the varnish-cli-bridge This program will listen for Varnish Cache commands and foward them to the Section hosted Varnish Cache platform.\nDownload Download the lastest Section cli bridge here. You will want the varnish-cli-bridge-vN.N.N-linux-amd64.tar.gz file.\nCollect configuration details There are 3 pieces of information required to run the bridge:\n API endpoint: This URL uniquely identifies your application within Section. Most often, you’ll need the “Production Varnish Cache Proxy API endpoint” from the Configuration \u0026gt; API page in Section’s management portal. API username: This is a username that has permission to perform API actions. API password: This is a password for the specified user to perform API actions.  Run as a service We have an Upstart script available to to run the bridge as a service.\nInstall Upstart if it is not already installed on your server. Copy the script above with the new name “varnish-cli-bridge.conf” into \/etc\/init\/.

Here we will be updating the Server List option with the endpoint for the Varnish Cache CLI Bridge you just installed. Add the entry 127.0.0.1:6082 to the list and hit \u0026ldquo;Save Config\u0026rdquo; in the upper right hand corner.\n  If you get an error (sample error in picture below), you should revisit the bridge installation process and ensure you have done that correctly.\n   Deviations from official Turpentine instructions Installation See the turpentine installation guide.\nStep 1-3: Skip these steps. There is no need to install or configure a local Varnish Cache server.\nConfiguration See the turpentine configuration guide.\nNo special configuration is required to use Turpentine with the bridge \u0026amp; Section.\nUpload Turpentine configuration to Section The configuration must be applied\/uploaded into Section by manually hitting the Apply Varnish Cache Configuration button on the Cache Management page.\nTesting There are 2 recommended tests to validate your implementation:\n Test Pages Are Coming From Cache - Reload your browser 3-5 times on a single page, You should start to see multiple Varnish Cache ID’s in the HTTP response headers (In a browser debugger such as Chromes debugger) and see page response times around ~50-100ms Test Bans Are Reaching the Section Platform - Using a Product page on your site refresh 3-5 times to ensure pages are in cache. Once the page is in cache, Add a product to your shopping cart. This will cause Turpentine to send a Ban statement to Section to clear out the block on all pages for the user that contains the shopping cart.

API API Section JSON RESTful API to manage the users, accounts, applications, environments, domains and logging.   Aperture Dashboard Section web portal to manage the users, accounts, applications, environments, domains and logging.   Application Website configuration Configuration for your content-delivery and proxy setup, monitors HTTP traffic from the client through your proxy stack to your origin and back again, and manages the state of your website content. Generally an Application is defined by the url for a website or web Application. Each Application may have multiple Environments (e.g. Production and Development) and can have multiple Users with access to the Environment(s) for that Application.   Domains www.yourdomain.com mysecond-domain.com Each application can also have multiple domains for any number of websites with the same proxy configuration setup, greatly simplifying the management process for many similar sites.   Edge Proxy Ingress \/ Edge Proxy Every application proxy stack begins with the Edge proxy.   Environment Staging, Development, Production etc Environment defines the functional space within which the Proxy Instance is working for the Application. Section means Users can seamlessly move a Proxy Stack configuration between Environments. An application supports multiple environments like staging, development, and production on git branches within the application repository. Each of these environments can have different proxy configurations.   Instance Software \u0026amp; Configuration Each User’s copy of the Proxy Stack for the application is referred to as an Instance. Generally, there will be multiple Instances of the Development Environment where there are multiple users working on the Proxy Stack for that Application. Usually, there will be only one Production instance and in normal development workflows, a limited number of instances for Test or Staging Environments.   Modules Software \u0026amp; Configuration Section offers modules of open source and commercial software solutions that form a proxy stack.   Proxy Reverse Proxy A Proxy or \u0026ldquo;Reverse Proxy” is the server handling requests within each environment e.g. Varnish Cache. A Proxy (or more technically correct “Reverse Proxy”) is the server handling requests within each environment (e.g. Varnish Cache ). The nature and configuration of the Proxy is subject to the changes a user may make in the respective environments. Section’s commands can then be called to synchronise the configuration of the Proxies between the Instances in each Environment.   Proxy Stack Chained Proxies Where more than one Proxy is “chained” together we refer to this as a Proxy Stack. Where more than one Proxy is “chained” together we refer to this as a Proxy Stack. E.g Combining two Proxies to work together such as Varnish Cache and Mod Security or Varnish Cache and Nginx would provide the user with a Proxy stack.   Support Customer Engineers Section is a managed platform and Customer Engineers are ready to support.   User User management Users can manage accounts, environments, applications etc. Users are defined by an email address. There may be many users per Account. A User may haver access to more than one Account. Each User may have access to multiple Environments within any Account. e.g. Development and Production    </p>",

							value: "Adding a New Domain to Section",
							label: "<p>When you want to add a domain to Section, it is sometimes unclear where that domains should fit into your existing account, application, and environment structure. This guide will help you decide whether it is most appropriate to create a new application, create a new environment, or add a new domain to an existing environment.\nMy new website is a staging\/uat site for a production site that I have running or want to run on Section The purpose of Section\u0026rsquo;s application-environment structure is to streamline the configuration testing and promotion process for modules in your stack. With respect to configuration, the definition of an application is a git repository, and the definition of an environment is a branch within that repository. This makes testing changes to the staging environment and then promoting them to the production environment as simple as a git merge and push.\nIf you want to add a staging site to Section, the best solution for most use cases is to add a new environment to the same application (or use the Staging environment that comes by default whenever you create a new environment).\nSummary: we recommend adding a new staging site to an existing application as a new environment.\nI want to add a new website to Section that is similar to one or more sites I already have running on Section Section maintains running containers for each module in your stack in each point of presence on a per environment basis. That means that if you assign www.example.com and www.demonstration.com to the same Section environment, the same containers will handle traffic for both sites. If you have a new site that has similar needs and configuration patterns to a site that is already running on section, then assigning both domains to the same environment greatly simplifies the overhead of managing them.\nWhen two sites have the same URI patterns for resources and routes that should and should not be cached (i.e. both are set up for HTML caching and use the same routes for admin functionality or checkout), then it often makes sense to assign both of these domains to the same environment.\nIt is even possible to assign two domains to the same environment when the websites are running on different origin servers. Section supports routing requests to alternate origins based on the incoming request\u0026rsquo;s hostname or other criteria.\nIf the websites are mostly the same but have a few important differences, you can manage this as well within a single configuration by building hostname specific logic into your Varnish Cache Configuration:\nif (req.url ~ \u0026quot;\/admin\u0026quot; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; req.http.host == \u0026quot;www.example.com\u0026quot;) { \/\/ Take action A } else if (req.url ~ \u0026quot;\/admin\u0026quot; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; req.http.host == \u0026quot;www.demonstration.com\u0026quot;) { \/\/ Take action B }  Summary: If two websites have similar CDN\/Edge compute needs, they should be mapped to the same environment.\nI want to add a new website that is very different from all the sites I have running on Section If you want to add a new site that has different needs from all the other sites you have running on Section, then creating a new application is often the best choice. As mentioned previously, one application corresponds to one git repository, so you will be able to manage the configuration for these two sites independently of one another. Some example use cases include:\n  Your new site is built in a different framework or has a different architecture such that you would need to write many site specific VCL directives (if using Varnish Cache).\n  Similar to the above, your new site is set up for a different kind of caching than your other sites. For example, site A is built for HTML caching via hole-punching, but site B caches HTML with ISE.\n  You want to run a different module configuration on the new site — such as adding or removing a WAF or image optimizer.\n  Note that it is possible to set up a new domain as another environment within the same application (Section supports multiple environments with names other than Staging or Production). While this allows all of your sites to share one git repository (a fact which does not particularly benefit you if the sites are different enough to not be mapped to the same environment), your sites will also share the same Kibana logs — meaning that logs from site A will be mixed in with logs from site B.\nSummary: If two websites have different configuration needs or require different modules to run in the stack, these two domains should be in separate applications\n</p><p>reverse</p><p>proxy,</p><p>CDN</p>",

							value: "Aperture Overview",
							label: "<p>Each Section environment has its own overview page. The overview page displays general information about the environment\u0026rsquo;s module stack and HTTP request flow, any recent errors between Section and the origin server, and a number of links to more detailed information about the environment such as DNS information and HTTP logs.\nModule Stack All module stack configurations running on Section begin with the edge module (the very first module that incoming HTTP requests hit when they enter Section) and ends with the LastProxy (the last module that incoming HTTP requests pass through before leaving Section and hitting your origin server). The modules in between can be configured to perfectly suite your needs using your environment\u0026rsquo;s advanced configuration. On the overview page, we display a graphic detailing the proxies currently running in your environment\u0026rsquo;s configuration and their current order.\n  HTTP Traffic Summary We also show you an overview graph that can be toggled between three metrics: Number of HTTP responses served per minute, Breakdown of error requests for the last hour, and Downstream response bandwidth served per minute. This data is pulled from Graphite in the Metrics view, so you can go here to dig deeper into the data.\n  Number of HTTP responses served per minute gives you a quick sense of the overall volume of traffic hitting your website, including all HTML content and all static resources like images \u0026amp; CSS files. This view is great for a general, low-resolution picture of how your site is doing.\nClicking the Error Responses button below the HTTP graph brings up a breakdown of all error responses served to your users in the last hour, separated out into 3XX (Redirections), 4XX (Client request errors) \u0026amp; 5XX (Server errors) errors. This graph provides a simple way to detect a recent increase in errors served. (#logs).\nDownstream response bandwidth served per minute shows you the total amount of bandwidth sent to your customers. This represents the volume of data sent, as opposed to the count (represented by the number of HTTP requests). If you see this increasing but your number of HTTP responses staying the same, then you may have increased the average size of content being requested. You can review the bandwidth by file type in Metrics to see what may be causing this increase.\nIn addition to the overview graph, we also show data depending on whether your application is set up with Varnish or Modsecurity.\nVarnish For Varnish Cache we show Cache hit, pass and misses for the last hour and Upstream request bandwidth served per minute.\n  Cache hit, pass and misses for the last hour shows the breakdown of how Varnish Cache handled your requests. The higher the hit percentage, the faster your website will perform and the less work required by your servers.\nUpstream request bandwidth served per minute shows the volume of data sent by the origin. The more content you cache using Varnish, the lower this will be. By lowering this number you decrease the amount of work required by your servers.\nModsecurity For Modsecurity we show Intercepts, audits and passes % for the last hour and Upstream request bandwidth served per minute.\n  Intercepts, audits and passes % for the last hour shows you the breakdown of how Modsecurity handled your requests. Intercepted means that modsecurity blocked the request (a function that must be activated in your configuration). Audits means that modsecurity looked at the request based on the rules you have turned on. Passes means that modsecurity did not look at the request.\nUpstream request bandwidth served per minute shows the volume of data sent by the origin. The more malicious requests you block using Modsecurity, the lower this will be. By lowering this number you decrease the amount of work required by your servers.\nOther Modules Depending on your configuration, you may see additional icons here for other modules such as Openresty, Kraken, or a Web Application Firewall. The overview page does not provide metrics for these additional modules like it does for Varnish and ModSecurity.\nTo dig into metrics further for Varnish, ModSecurity, or another module in your stack, go to the Metrics tab within you r Section portal and visit our Monitoring documentation and our Debugging documentation.\n</p><p>metrics,</p><p>grafana,</p><p>graphite,</p><p>kibana,</p><p>varnish,</p><p>modsecurity,</p><p>website</p><p>performance,</p><p>website</p><p>security,</p><p>content</p><p>delivery</p><p>network,</p><p>CDN</p>",

							value: "Bare Domains",

Notice there is no prefix like \u0026ldquo;www.\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;shop.\u0026rdquo; before example.com.\nIn most situations, we recommend moving off your bare domain so that your website uses a prefix. There are advantages to doing this:\n You\u0026rsquo;ll get better manageability of your DNS. Your security may be improved.  There\u0026rsquo;s a good discussion on this topic here: https:\/\/www.yes-www.org\/why-use-www\/\nCommon Misconceptions About Moving from a Bare Domain to a Subdomain As engineers, here are some of the common questions we are faced with.\nMy SEO people say that moving the domain will kill SEO This isn\u0026rsquo;t correct. If you redirect your bare domain traffic to a domain with a prefix (eg. HTTP redirect example.com to www.example.com) using HTTP 301 redirects, search engines will update their indexes accordingly.\nMy marketing people say that \u0026ldquo;the brand\u0026rdquo; is the domain name without a prefix This doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter either. They can continue to use the bare domain in printed materials, and links on the Internet, without any effect on user experience, when HTTP 301 redirects are put in place.\nI Can\u0026rsquo;t Convince the Team, and I Really Need Bare Domains That\u0026rsquo;s fine. There are some DNS providers that allow you to fake the CNAME at the zone apex.\nAsk your DNS provider if they support ALIAS records. This is where the DNS provider actually does the CNAME lookup on the DNS server. So instead of responding with a CNAME record for the user to look up, they do the lookup first. They then respond with the A records.\nIf your DNS provider doesn\u0026rsquo;t support ALIAS records, then you need to move DNS hosting. Section provides a high quality, global, anycast-based DNS service free of charge to our users. You could use our DNS hosting, or any provider that supports ALIAS records at the zone apex.\nIf you have any questions, please ask in the Community Slack Channel.

These config changes are typically made under Advanced Config -\u0026gt; varnish -\u0026gt; default.vcl for the respective branch.\nVCL syntax Below is an example of how to deliver a synthetic 403 response using VCL syntax 4.0. This example will deliver a 403 response if the request matches the URI path \u0026ldquo;\/admin\u0026rdquo;:\nsub vcl_recv { if (req.url ~ \u0026#34;\/admin\u0026#34;) { return (synth(803, \u0026#34;Forbidden\u0026#34;)); } } sub vcl_synth { if (resp.status == 803) { set resp.status = 403; return (deliver); } }  This is just an example of how to block a request using Varnish Cache. You can utilize many different patterns to block a request. E.g. check for user agents, country codes (example below), IP addresses, etc.\n Blocking traffic based on GEO Region The section.io platform performs GEO region lookup at the Edge and sets a custom header section-io-geo-country that contains the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code such as US for the United States, or AU for Australia. There are also a number of other header that are set which can be useful.

Manage your IP blacklist from within your application repository The IP blacklist is stored in the section.config.json file in the root of the git repository for your web site. You can view this by going to https:\/\/aperture.section.io\/, selecting your site and then going to the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Config\u0026rdquo; page.\n  Simple proxy stack   The ip_blacklist field is applied to an environment (living at the same level as origin ). It is a list (array) of IP v4 addresses and\/or CIDR notation routing prefixes.\nThe request blacklist is specified via an ip_blacklist property inside one of the environment objects found within the section.config.json file inside your Advanced Configuration tab of Aperture — for example:\n{ \u0026quot;proxychain\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;environments\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Production\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;origin.example.com\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;ip_blacklist\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;192.0.2.1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;198.51.100.0\/24\u0026quot; ] }, \u0026quot;Development\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;origin.example.com\u0026quot; } } } }  The section.config.json file blacklist accepts individual IP addresses as well as entire subnets. This configuration file would block all requests from 192.0.2.1 and from the IP range of 198.51.100.0-198.51.100.255. The origin server would never even see the requests and the Section platform would deliver 403 forbidden errors directly to the (likely malicious) clients.\nIf you prefer, you can create a custom response to entities on the IP blacklist.\n</p><p>bot,</p><p>bot</p><p>blocker,</p><p>spammers,</p><p>crawlers,</p><p>website</p><p>performance,</p><p>webpage</p><p>speed,</p><p>website</p><p>security,</p><p>content</p><p>delivery</p><p>network,</p><p>CDN</p>",

This origin address is stored in a JSON file in the root of the git repository for your application. You can view this by going to https:\/\/aperture.section.io\/, selecting your site and then going to the “Advanced Config” page.\nThis gives you a view of the git repository for your site. From there you can open section.config.json.\nThis is the configuration file for your site on Section. It contains the proxy stack you have configured and environment specific configuration settings.\nEach environment has its own section in the file where you can specify config options for that environment. There are a number of possible config settings but for now the one we are interested in is origin.address.\nTo change the address of your production environment Click the Edit button on the page. This will open the online file editor. From there you can change the value of the origin address to the new IP address or CNAME. To save the change, put a description in the Commit Message field (remember, this is all git) and click Commit. This will do a git commit \u0026amp; push which will trigger a deploy to the Section delivery nodes to apply the new origin address.\nWithin a few seconds Section will be serving requests from your new webserver.\nWe will direct all http requests to port 80 and all https requests to port 443 on your origin server. We do not support any other origin ports.\nOverride the Host request header sent to the origin Normally, the same Host request header sent by the User-Agent will be forwarded to the origin server as-is. However if your origin expects a different Host request header, an override can be specified in the section.config.json file.\nThe alternate Host request header should be specified via a host_header property inside the origin object, for example:\n\u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;origin.example.com\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;host_header\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;override.example.com\u0026quot; }  Removal of X-Forwarded-Proto and other request headers Some origin servers and load balancers don\u0026rsquo;t handle certain request headers like X-Forwarded-Proto correctly. You can remove them by editing your section.config.json by adding a remove_request_headers key for each origin.\n\u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;origin.example.com\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;remove_request_headers\u0026quot;: [ \u0026quot;x-forwarded-proto\u0026quot; ] }  Disable persistent connections between Section and the origin By default, if your origin allows HTTP\/1.1 persistent connections Section will maintain a number of connections open between our reverse proxies and your origin web servers to reduce the cost of performing a TCP 3-way handshake (or more for TLS connections) for each HTTP request forwarded to the origin. This is also known as HTTP Keep-alive.\nWhile persistent connections are generally recommended for the best performance, there are occasional scenarios where you may need to disable it. For example, if you origin load balancer injects a sticky-session cookie only for the first response on a given connection because it assumes one connection equals one browser.\nTo disable the persistent connection behavior, add a disable_keepalive property to the relevant origin in your section.config.json file.\n\u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;origin.example.com\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;disable_keepalive\u0026quot;: true }  Leverage alternate origin locations A common customer requirement is to send a portion of traffic to an alternate origin location. This is often used to segment the uri space or flag a specific type of request to be sent to an alternate location to the standard origin.\nAn examples of this use case would be to send any request to \/assets\/images\/.* in your application to an S3 bucket instead of your origin application servers.\nTo implement this feature there are 2 elements to configure, Please see our Alternate origin documentation here: https:\/\/www.section.io\/docs\/multiple-origins\/\nEnable SNI If your origin has SNI enabled and serves multiple secure(HTTPS) websites using different SSL certificates then you should Enable SNI under Origins \u0026gt; Common Settings in the aperture portal.\n  This will enable our platform to pass the server name through TLS\/SNI when establishing a connection with your origin.\nThis option is turned off by default.\n</p><p>origin</p><p>address,</p><p>origin</p><p>server,</p><p>origin,</p><p>cache,</p><p>cached</p><p>data,</p><p>content</p><p>delivery</p><p>network,</p><p>CDN</p>",

							value: "Configure Dynamic Content Caching",
							label: "<p>Caching is so effective at boosting website performance because delivering web content involves extreme repetition. Web servers receive requests for identical static assets and HTML documents thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of times per day. Caching allows the web server delegate this repetition to the caching layer and only respond to a small fraction of these requests. Eliminating this repetition makes your web server significantly more efficient and can drastically reduce server costs.\nThis simple formula becomes more complicated, however, when a website introduces authenticated content. These assets are no longer identical — they have important personal information unique to the user making the request. When authentication is involved, caching becomes dangerous. The last thing you want is session leakage: a situation in which one user\u0026rsquo;s personal information is cached and served to another user. Below are two techniques that have been developed to maximize caching while avoiding the potential downfalls of dealing with authenticated content.\nIntelligent Session Establishment (ISE) Because of the significant risks around caching authenticated content, Varnish Cache does not cache backend responses with any set-cookie headers by default. It also does not look up responses in cache for any requests with cookies on them. The thinking here is that if a backend is responding with a set-cookie header, the response is likely to have some authenticated, user-specific content, or if a client has a cookie, then they\u0026rsquo;re asking for the same. This makes sense in theory, but the problem is that many modern web development frameworks set cookies on non-authenticated responses, greatly reducing Varnish\u0026rsquo;s caching rate out of the box. To Varnish Cache , a much higher percentage of modern web traffic looks uncacheable than actually is.\nIntelligent Session Establishment is a technique that solves this problem by using Varnish Cache Configuration Language (VCL) to cache and look up in cache the traffic that Varnish Cache thinks is authenticated but actually is not.\nIn order to implement this, you need to know a few things about your platform. The first thing you need to know is the actual cookie that establishes your session. Once you know this, you can specifically instruct Varnish Cache to pass over any traffic that has or is setting this cookie, but cache ones that have or are setting other cookies. Next, you need to know what routes you want Varnish Cache to treat as uncacheable no matter what. This would be routes like \u0026lsquo;\/checkout\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;\/admin\u0026rsquo;. Once you have written VCL excluding these two types of requests, you can instruct Varnish Cache to cache other kinds of traffic.\nFor more information on implementing ISE, check out this article.\nHole-Punching Even though authenticated pages clearly have user-specific and therefore uncacheable personal information, they also have a lot of generic and reusable resources on them. User account pages, for example, are literally designed to display unique personal data, but they also reuse much of the same HTML and CSS for every customer. As long as we\u0026rsquo;re sending a user account page via a single response, though, we miss out on caching all this generic content.\nHole-punching is a design pattern that solves this problem by loading the authenticated and unauthenticated content for a single page with different requests. To implement hole-punching for a user account page, for example, you would configure the application to respond to such a request with the generic HTML document and other reusable resources, and then load the user-specific information with additional requests — either AJAX or ESI calls (Edge Side Includes). This way, you can cache the generic content and leave the authenticated content completely alone.\nHTML Streaming No matter how session-specific and customized a page is, typically the head of the HTML document for a given URL is the same for every user. From a website optimization perspective, anything that is reliably the same can be cached. HTML Streaming is a technique that leverages this consistent repetition of the head tag in order to optimize delivery. With HTML streaming implemented, our platform separates out the head and body of incoming HTML documents and then caches the head portion. For all subsequent requests for that URL, Varnish Cache delivers the HTML head immediately with an embedded ESI tag which requests the body.\nBeyond the obvious performance benefits of caching a piece of the HTML document, HTML streaming offers extremely fast time-to-first-byte on pages that cannot be cached according to traditional methods.\nSummary ISE is a technique that is implemented at the Section level and allows us to cache as many valid responses as possible. Hole-punching is a design pattern implemented on your origin application that separates authenticated and unauthenticated information into separate requests to allow for maximum caching. HTML streaming offers quick time-to-first-bytes by selectively caching HTML documents.\nFor implementation questions on any of these, contact our engineering team at support@section.io\n</p><p>dynamic</p><p>caching,</p><p>caching,</p><p>cache</p>",

Hit the green play button again to view the results of the average time_taken_ms for each module type.  Here is an example of the finished product with clear increases in LastProxy access log times. This is a strong indicator for a slowdown at the origin application:\n  Next Steps: If you see a pattern of clear increases in LastProxy time_taken_ms values that resembles the above screenshot, the slowdown is likely being caused by the origin server and not Section. From here, look into origin server logs and an origin server monitoring solution such as New Relic if available.\nIf the above investigation reveals increased time_taken_ms values for Edge, Varnish Cache, or another module in your stack but a stable LastProxy value, this could indicate an degradation of service within the Section platform.

The same is true if you register a bare domain record such as example.com. Each domain must be specified in full in order for the request to be accepted by Section.\nIf you would like your Section application to respond to multiple domains, you can add them on bottom of the the Domains page under Domains.

							value: "Edge Proxy",
							label: "<p>Ingress \/ Edge Proxy Every Section application proxy stack implicitly begins with the Edge proxy. The Edge proxy is the endpoint to which the User-Agent (eg web browser) connects and it has a few responsibilities:\n Performing the TLS handshake for HTTPS connections Routing requests to the corresponding application proxy stack Implementing the HTTP\/2 protocol Request correlation Serving custom error pages  This enables a consistent experience on the Section platform regardless of which proxies are in your application\u0026rsquo;s stack or in which sequence they appear.\nIP geolocation For each incoming request, the Edge proxy attempts to resolve the client\u0026rsquo;s connecting IP address to a geographic location. The results of the lookup are then exposed to the other proxies in the proxy stack and to the origin web server as HTTP request headers. These headers are:\n section-io-geo-country-code - the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code such as US for the United States, or AU for Australia. section-io-geo-country-name - the country name such as United States or Australia. section-io-geo-country - the country code such as AU. section-io-geo-region - the region name such as Western Australia. section-io-geo-asn - ASN number 64098. section-io-geo-region-code - examples include CA and VA for US IPs or NSW for Australian IPs. section-io-geo-region-name - examples include California and Virginia for US IPs or New South Wales for Australian IPs. section-io-geo-city - examples include New York, Mountain View, Sydney, and Drummoyne. section-io-geo-latlon - the approximate latitude and longitude in the format -33.8696,151.2099. section-io-geo-postal-code - examples include 2047 for Drummoyne, NSW, Australia and 80302 for Boulder, CO, USA. section-io-geo-dma-code - The Nielsen Designated Market Area ID as used by DoubleClick. Only for US IPs.  Not all headers are populated for all IP addresses.\nThe latitude, longitude, country code, and city values are also available in the access logs.\nClient IP Detection Historically, Section has logged a header called remote_addr that contained the connecting client\u0026rsquo;s IP address. Due to GDPR compliance, however, the value of the address\u0027 last segment is now redacted and replaced with a zero. Despite this change, Section still captures the connecting client\u0026rsquo;s IP address and sends it upstream under a header called True-Client-IP. This header is not logged by our platform (and therefore is not visible in Kibana), but can be referenced within any proxy in your stack (varnish, pagespeed, etc.) and is visible to your origin server. True-Client-IP is the same IP address used for the IP geolocation.\nThis request header can be used in a number of ways:\n Fraud detection IP Whitelist\/Blacklisting, including restricting access to particular urls. Logging client usage Rate limiting  Section also sets the X-Forwarded-For header if you need to use that, however this header will often be a list of IP addresses depending on how the request has been proxied prior to arriving at Section and is not always reliable.\nRequest correlation When the Edge proxy handles each incoming request, a unique identifier is generated and is added to the request via a section-io-id HTTP request header.\nThis request header then propagates through to each proxy in your application\u0026rsquo;s proxy stack and ultimately to your application\u0026rsquo;s configured origin web server. When the final response is returned from your application, via the proxy stack, to the User-Agent, the Edge proxy also inserts the same identifier as a section-io-id HTTP response header.\nThe section-io-id value is available in all the proxy logs provided by Aperture to enable easy correlation of log entries across the different proxies in the stack. You can also choose to log the section-io-id request header on your origin server to aid with diagnostics.\nBy providing the identifier as a request header, its value can be consumed in your chosen proxies. For example, Varnish Cache can refer to req.http.section-io-id in the VCL.\nThe format of the section-io-id identifier is subject to change without notice so it should be treated as an opaque string and no meaning should be inferred from its value.\nContent compresssion By default Section will gzip responses to requests that can be compressed. This is typically text content like HTML, CSS \u0026amp; Javascript files. We will enable this compression even if your origin server does not send gzipped responses to improve performance for your site\u0026rsquo;s visitors. In the unlikely scenario that compression causes issues for your site, you can disable this feature in Advanced Configuration.\nEdit the section.config.json and add \u0026quot;maintain_upstream_content_encoding\u0026quot;: true to the environment you want to disable gzip encoding on.\n\u0026quot;environments\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;Production\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;origin.example.com\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;host_header\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;override.example.com\u0026quot; }, \u0026quot;maintain_upstream_content_encoding\u0026quot;: true } }  Commit this change and all responses will retain the content-encoding that is sent from the origin.\nTable of contents  </p><p>ingress</p><p>edge</p><p>proxy,</p><p>tls,</p><p>tls</p><p>handshake,</p><p>http2,</p><p>http\/2,</p><p>proxy</p><p>configuration,</p><p>reverse</p><p>proxies</p>",

You will be able to see the amount of HTTP Requests served per minute and the corresponding bytes served per minute.\nWe also give you an overview of the HTTP responses served by status code, which is helpful for debugging errors. Following this chart is a break down of all client side errors (4xx status code) and server side errors (5xx status code).\nVarnish Cache Overview The “Varnish Cache Overview” dashboard, which is only has data viewable if you have a Varnish Cache module setup on your application. These charts go into detail on the hit, miss, pass ratios and help you understand how many of your requests are able to be handled by Varnish Cache .\nA “hit” means that the cache was able to respond to the request. A “miss” means that the cache was checked for the the content but it wasn’t there and did not respond to the request (and subsequently sent the request to the server). A “pass” means that the cache was not checked for the content and the request went straight to the server.\nThese charts give you a good high level understanding of how much content you are serving from the cache. The higher the number of cache hits, the faster your website loads and the less work is required by your servers. You can increase the overall cache hit count by caching more content, which can be managed in your Varnish Cache configurations.\nVarnish Cache Request Performance The “Varnish Cache Request Performance” dashboard goes detail on time to serve and bandwidth by hit type, content type, and response type. Here we start to go into detail on time to serve and bandwidth by hit type, content type, and response type.\nHit type refers to Hit, Miss or Pass. With time to serve, you can start seeing the impact a cache hit has on speed to deliver content and bandwidth required by your servers.\nContent type refers to what kind of content was requested: images, html, css, etc. This gives you a good idea of what type of content takes the longest to serve and requires to most work from your servers. It should provide a good starting indication of where to focus your efforts on which type of content to cache.\nResponse type refers to how your website responded to their request. A 200 code means that the content was delivered successfully. A 3XX means there was a redirect. Since redirects load two different objects, they require more time and resources to deliver than a 200. If you see an increase in 3XX codes, you should review your redirects and see if they are necessary or if they can be removed. 4XX and 5XX codes mean that the content was not delivered successfully and they should be reviewed in your Kibana logs to understand how to fix the issue.\nVarnish Cache Hit Rates The “Varnish Cache Hit Rates” dashboard breaks down the overall hit rates by content type: HTML, Images, CSS, Javascript. This breaks down the overall hit rates by content type: HTML, Images, CSS, Javascript.\n HTML is the set of instructions required to load the page. Images are any images or icons you load. CSS is the style instruction for how to load images, text, and content on the page. And JS is small scripts your browser will run as when it is instructed to by the HTML.  For each content type, you can view your hit rates, volume of requests, and time to serve.\n</p><p>monitoring,</p><p>Grafana,</p><p>metrics,</p><p>Varnish</p><p>Cache</p><p>handling</p>",

Although Section provides a number of useful dashboards in Grafana, you can use these graphite metrics to build your own. You can click “Open in new window,” located at the top of the frame, to have more space to work.\n  You will see some folder on the left with different environments. The first environment will usually be your production environment, the second your development environment, and then any other environments. To see production data for Varnish, you would go to the first environment \u0026gt; section hosted \u0026gt; Varnish Cache.\nYou can use this data to create graphs. For example: Varnish Cache \u0026gt; content_type \u0026gt; text-html \u0026gt; status \u0026gt; 200 \u0026gt; time_taken \u0026gt; mean will show me the mean time it took to serve a successful html doc.\n  By clicking “Graph Data” under the graph, I can edit the data in the graph. For instance, “edit” allows me to manually update the query and if I replace “text-html” with “*” it will show me all content types, not just html docs. Keep in mind when you edit, Graphite will try to auto fill your response. You can click out of the drop down to have it keep your entered text (required when using *), or you can select from the drop down.\n  You can also “apply function” to the data which can sum different queries, change the time interval for the data points, add a second axis, change legends, and much more.\nThe “Graph Options” button under the graph will let you change the look of the graph. Clicking the clock or calendar icon above the graph will allow you to change the time range of the data. There is so much more you can do here, and you can follow the Graphite documentation to manipulate the data in the way that you need. This documentation for available functions is a great one to review. https:\/\/graphite.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/functions.html\n</p><p>monitoring,</p><p>graphite,</p><p>metrics,</p><p>logs</p>",

							value: "Magento Metrics",
							label: "<p>Section has an extension for Magento customers that allows business managers to access Section site metrics. These metrics provide visibility into the impact caching has on your website, without having to login to the Section application. You can get the extension for your Magento website by going to the Magento Marketplace.\nThere are three metrics we show in the extension: Overall Cache Hit, HTML Cache Hit, and HTTP Response Codes. The extension in Magento is meant to give you an overview on the current status, but by having a developer look into your Varnish Cache configuration settings or your logs in the in the Section application, you can improve all of these metrics.\nOverall Cache Hit Overall Cache Hit count shows the number of cache hits from all content types. A cache hit is when a customer requests content from your site (whether it\u0026rsquo;s an image, html document, etc) and the cache is able to respond to that request. The chart shows successful responses (responses with a 200 HTTP response code) in 4 hour increments over the previous 7 days. The timezone is based on the location of the Magento user.\nThe more often the cache can answer your customer requests, the higher the overall cache hit count. The higher the number of cache hits, the faster your website loads and the less work is required by your servers. This means you can earn more revenue by providing a better experience for your customers, and you can save money by not having to purchase additional servers with Magento.\nYou can increase the overall cache hit count by caching more content. To setup caching, login to Section aperture account and add configurations for Varnish.\nHTML Cache Hit HTML Cache Hit count shows the number of cache hits for HTML documents. HTML documents are a set of instructions used to create the webpage and determine how all other content types get loaded on the page. The chart shows successful responses (responses with a 200 HTTP response code) in 4 hour increments over the previous 7 days. The timezone is based on the location of the Magento user.\nAs with overall cache hit, the more often the cache can answer requests for the HTML document, the higher the HTML cache hit count. The higher the number of HTML cache hits, the faster your website loads and the less work is required by your servers. HTML documents are generated for you by Magento and they consume a significant amount of your server resources. By focusing on HTML document caching as the first type of content you try to optimize, you are focusing on the content type that can make the biggest initial improvement to both your performance and server resources. This means you can earn more revenue by providing a better experience for your customers, and you can save money by not having to purchase additional servers with Magento.\nTo increase the HTML cache hit count, you should start serving these documents from the cache instead of from your server. To setup caching, login to Section aperture account and add configurations for Varnish.\nHTTP Status Codes HTTP status codes show how your website responded to a customer request. The extension in Magento is meant to give you an overview, but we recommend that a developer look into the logs in the Section application in order to review the codes as described below in order to make improvements. The chart shows responses by type in 4 hour increments over the previous 7 days. The timezone is based on the location of the Magento user. Here is what each of the response types mean and what you should do about them:\nA 200 code is a normal response, which means the customer can get the content they requested (such as your full website page, an image on the page, etc). You want as many 200 codes as possible, as it means a good experience for your customers.\nA 3XX code typically means there was a redirect of some kind. This does not mean anything is broken, however, it may mean longer loading times for your customers as at least two items need to be served instead of one (the original and the redirect). You will want to review your 3XX codes and make sure the redirects you have setup for your website are necessary, and then remove the unnecessary ones. You can also update marketing campaigns to point traffic directly to the end destination instead of continuing to point to a site that will trigger a redirect.\nA 4XX or 5XX code means that your customer’s request was not answered and can indicate broken links or application error. The difference between a 4XX and a 5XX has to do with why the error took place, and a developer can dig into each error to find out the reason. The most common error in the bucket is a 404 which means that the page was not found. You can setup custom error messages in Section to give your customers a better experience when this does happen until you fix the link.\nA 7XX code has to do with the connection, and may be the result of problems with the connection your customer is using to make the request and not the result of your website.\n</p><p>magento,</p><p>varnish,</p><p>Varnish</p><p>Cache</p><p>,</p><p>metrics,</p><p>magento</p><p>extension,</p><p>cache,</p><p>page</p><p>speed,</p><p>webpage</p><p>speed</p>",

In order to go live on Section, you need to setup a CNAME record pointing to the Section platform. While this is simple to do for any subdomain such as www, creating a CNAME record for a bare domain can cause some problems. This is because a CNAME record trumps all other records and can cause issues with MX records — potentially leading to broken email etc.\nThere are several workarounds to this problem:\n  Switch to running your site on “www”. This means that users will type in www.domain.com to get to your website. You would then setup a HTTP 301 redirect from the bare domain to the www version so that users (and SEO) are automatically redirected to the “www” site. With this configuration fully in place, the bare domain points to the origin, www points to Section, and the origin servers redirects to the www. For a deeper discussion of the impact of serving your website off of the www instead of the bare domain, see this article.\n  Use a DNS provider that supports a special ALIAS\/ANAME record type at the bare domain. These records are like CNAME records but do not cause the issues described above.

							label: "<p>Proxy Requirements The following defines the interaction between the proxy container and the Section proxy hosting platform:\nEssential  Proxy should listen on TCP port 80 for HTTP\/1.1 on its public interface — never HTTPS or any other port. It may listen on other ports on its loopback interface for internal use only. Proxy must connect upstream to next-hop:80 as HTTP, never HTTPS. The platform will ensure \u0026ldquo;next-hop\u0026rdquo; resolves to the next proxy in the chain or the origin — whichever is next upstream.  The proxy must resolve the next-hop name first via \/etc\/hosts and then via the nameservers and other options defined by \/etc\/resolv.conf. All other DNS resolution (e.g. external resolvers) are unsupported and will be blocked by the firewall.   Proxy must handle logs according to these requirements:  All HTTP access must be written to the container\u0026rsquo;s stdout stream in either JSON format or LTSV format. All diagnostic or error logs must be written to the container\u0027 stderr stream. Log files should not be used. They will not be accessible outside the proxy and the proxy is responsible managing file growth.   An executable at \/opt\/section\/validate.sh will be executed by Aperture during the git push pre-receive hook to validate that the user\u0026rsquo;s proxy configuration is correct.  This executable must exist, even if it takes no action. It does not need to be a shell script, any file with this name and appropriate file mode is acceptable. The user\u0026rsquo;s configuration for the proxy will be available in the \/opt\/proxy_config\/ directory. The process must return a zero exit code and zero output if config is valid. The process must return non-zero exit code if config is invalid and output reason for validation failure to the stderr stream. The script will have zero network connectivity so the process will not be able to issue requests to external services as part of the validation.    Optional  Proxy should expect that \/opt\/proxy_config\/ directory will contain the configuration for this proxy. This will be the proxy-specific subdirectory from the Section Application git repository. Assume the directory contents are read-only.  Things you can rely on  Proxy can expect X-Forwarded-Proto request header will equal https for HTTPS connections from the User-Agent. Assume HTTP otherwise. Proxy can expect X-Forwarded-For request header will be present. A True-Client-IP request header will also be present and contain a single IP representing the downstream client\u0026rsquo;s address extracted from the X-Forwarded-For header. Proxy should configure HTTP\/1.1 keep-alive to be enabled for both downstream and upstream connections.  Additional Considerations  The proxy image will be published in a publicly accessible docker repository. This repository allows your image to be downloaded to both production servers and section.io users using the Developer PoP.  </p><p>reverse</p><p>proxy,</p><p>CDN</p>",

							value: "Run multiple origins in one environment",
							label: "<p>A Guide to hooking up multiple origin servers to one Section environment and orchestrating incoming HTTP traffic distribution among them. When you have a single origin or upstream server, your section.config.json file will look something like this:\n\u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;origin.example.com\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;host_header\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;override.example.com\u0026quot;\r}\r However, there are cases where it is useful to have two different upstream services — perhaps you want to make two backend systems appear on the same domain.\nSection supports multiple origins in a single configuration which allows you to run multiple backends into one domain.\nAdding More than One Origin Server Adding another backend service or origin to your configuration involves the following steps:\n1) Define Alternate Origins To define multiple origins, we need to add configuration information about the additional origins to our section.config.json file.\nWorking from the case above, we can add a second origin by adding an alernate_origins block.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of adding origin2.example.com to section.config.json\n\u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;origin.example.com\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;host_header\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;override.example.com\u0026quot;\r},\r\u0026quot;alternate_origins\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;origin2_example_com\u0026quot;: {\r\u0026quot;address\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;origin2.example.com\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;host_header\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;origin2.example.com\u0026quot;\r}\r}\r Note that the alternate origin definition is a named object. We advise naming the alternate origin similarly to the address field.\nThe address field tells Section the IP address or DNS name that it should connect to. You will also want to specify the host_header that will be used on the HTTP requests that Section makes to this upstream.\n2) Configure your Section proxy stack to forward requests to the alternate origin Once you have established multiple origins by configuring your section.config.json file, you can choose to route incoming requests to different origins based on criteria of your choosing. When an incoming request hits the LastProxy(The final proxy in your chain), LastProxy looks for request headers and routes the request to the specified origin.\nGenerally speaking, this is done within the Varnish Cache proxy. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example using Varnish Cache VCL that you could incorporate into your default.vcl.\nsub vcl_recv {\rif (req.url ~ \u0026quot;sitemap.xml\u0026quot; ) {\rset req.http.section-origin = \u0026quot;origin2_example_com\u0026quot;;\r}\r}\r This if statement would be included in your existing vcl_recv function, or, as is allowed with vcl files, could be written as a part of a new vcl_recv block for the sake of organization.\nThis example says \u0026ldquo;If the requested URL contains sitemap.xml, then add a new header, section-origin, with the value origin2_example_com\u0026rdquo;.\nNow, when Section receives a request for sitemap.xml it will add the HTTP request header, which signals the LastProxy to forward the request to the specified alternative origin instead of your primary origin.\n</p><p>multiple</p><p>origins,</p><p>multiple</p><p>upstreams,</p><p>origin</p><p>address,</p><p>origin</p><p>server,</p><p>origin,</p><p>cache,</p><p>cached</p><p>data,</p><p>content</p><p>delivery</p><p>network,</p><p>CDN</p>",

Select one of the webpagetest waterfalls and click on the response. The Section id provides you with confirmation that the test has traversed the Section platform.\n  4 Optimize Your Website Performance Now you can modify your VCL in Section platform and re run multiple tests for caching or modify the page to serve entirely HTTPS so you can take advantage of Section HTTP\/2 platform.\nThe cache hit headers will be apparent on the responses you see in webpagetest.\nYou can also then correlate the responses to your logs and metrics in Section portal. Simply take a copy of the Section ID for a particular response anc copy and paste it into the query frame in Kibana in Section portal. This will provide you with detail for that particular request and how it was dealt with at the Section platform.\n  5 Rinse and Repeat This process can allow you to see the impact you can have on your website with Section.

The source of complexity here is dealing with the network bridge between the host machine and the Minikube virtual machine. The following is a set of directions for implementing this using virtual box and a local server running on port 80, but the necessary configuration may vary if you have an alternative setup.\n Start your local server on port 80. Start Minikube. Once Minikube is running and it\u0026rsquo;s network has been established, you should be able to visit your localhost server on both 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.99.1 (If not, subsequent steps will not work).

In the DevPop UI, add both 192.168.99.1 and the relevant hostname (such as www.example.com) as the origin for the Section configuration you wish to run in front of your origin server. In your hostfile, map the hostname you set in the previous step (www.example.com) to the IP address of Minikube (likely 192.168.99.100 — verify by running minikube ip in your command line). Visit your hostname www.example.com in your browser. If everything is configured correctly, then your browser will send the request to DevPoP on 192.168.99.100, which will then pass it to the local origin server running on 192.168.99.1.

You will also need to set the grace period of the object.\nsub vcl_backend_response { if (beresp.status \u0026gt;= 500 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; beresp.status \u0026lt;= 599) { return (abandon); } ... set beresp.grace = 24h; }  Step 2 - vcl_synth In vcl_synth we need to check the resp.status for a 503 code as this is the code set by return(abandon). If this is the case, we will utilize restart to run through the VCL code again.\nsub vcl_synth { if (resp.status == 503) { return (restart); } ... }  Step 3 - vcl_hit This part is where we actually tell Varnish Cache to serve stale content. If you are not using your own sub vcl_hit then this is the built in sub vcl_hit routine. A great explanation of the following code is provided in the Varnish docs\nsub vcl_hit { if (obj.ttl \u0026gt;= 0s) { \/\/ A pure unadulterated hit, deliver it  return (deliver); } if (obj.ttl \u002b obj.grace \u0026gt; 0s) { \/\/ Object is in grace, deliver it  \/\/ Automatically triggers a background fetch  return (deliver); } \/\/ fetch \u0026amp; deliver once we get the result  return (miss); }  Testing You can test this logic, by enabling maintenance mode on your server which will serve some type of 500 error. Keep in mind if the request is not in the cache before your origin goes down, the end user will still receive an error.\n</p><p>CDN,</p><p>content</p><p>delivery</p><p>network,</p><p>performance,</p><p>stale</p><p>content</p>",

As an example, the certificate chain for www.example.com looks like this:\nDigiCert (the CA root) \\- DigiCert SHA2 High Assurance Server CA (an intermediate cert) \\- www.example.com (the end-entity cert)  If you have any intermediate certificates in your chain you should have them in a separate file. You can and should omit the root certificate.\nThe certificate chain for www.example.com result would look like this:\npublic certificate at the top:\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIIF6DCCBNCgAwIBAgIQBBHej1O0YvalqGG3EuxrWTANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBw MQswCQYDVQQGEwJVUzEVMBMGA1UEChMMRGlnaUNlcnQgSW5jMRkwFwYDVQQLExB3 ... tOiS1jXb8xWWRRZyxrZbpaybPN3qkrNdqxBlyuPIy2u0UKYuovcup8a9x7ZfoJsB I5JUNzQIPHaH0kP40DdTBNmczS4UiWaoY3pnlw== -----END CERTIFICATE-----  followed by any intermediate certificate(s):\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIIEsTCCA5mgAwIBAgIQBOHnpNxc8vNtwCtCuF0VnzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBs ... 0wGjIChBWUMo0oHjqvbsezt3tkBigAVBRQHvFwY\u002b3sAzm2fTYS5yh\u002bRp\/BIAV0Ae cPUeybQ= -----END CERTIFICATE-----  Again most lines have been omitted and replace with \u0026hellip;\nThe last input you require is your certificate’s corresponding RSA private key in PEM format. It will look slightly different, something like this:\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- MIICXAIBAAKBgQCqGKukO1De7zhZj6\u002bH0qtjTkVxwTCpvKe4eCZ0FPqri0cb2JZf wmJG8wVQZKjeGcjDOL5UlsuusFncCzWBQ7RKNUSesmQRMSGkVb1\/3j\u002bskZ6UtW\u002b5 ...

Also, unlike the default for some Base64 encoding tools, the line length must be 64 characters.\nIn most scenarios the openssl software can help produce the required files and convert them to the appropriate format.\n3) Install the certificate in Section Once you have your certificate and key in the formats described above, you can install them into Section.\nLog in to Aperture for your application, and in the sidebar under the Set up header select HTTPS. Copy \u0026amp; paste the certificate files you prepared earlier into the input boxes as labeled, then click Save Changes. Make sure the certificates are in the proper order. For help on that, check out [our guide] (\/docs\/how-to\/https\/determine-tls-certificate-order)\nThis will deploy your certificate out to our delivery nodes.\nOnce you have saved your public certificates and private key, when you come back to the HTTPS page the private key will not be displayed on screen as it would be a security risk to display it.\nUpload a certificate using the API 1) To add an additional domain certificate to your application via the API POST \/account\/{accountId}\/application\/{applicationId}\/environment\/{environmentName}\/domain\/{hostName}\nNote: Domains can only be added to a root application (ie pathPrefix of \/). Domains added to this application\u0026rsquo;s environment will also be used for the corresponding environment in the sub-apps.\nIf there is no body payload, the domain name will have a Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt certificate provisioned for it. A custom certificate can be provided in this format:\n{ \u0026quot;public_certificates\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;private_key\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot; }  2) To remove a domain via the API DELETE \/account\/{accountId}\/application\/{applicationId}\/environment\/{environmentName}\/domain\/{hostName}\nTo add a custom certificate to an existing domain via the API:\nPOST \/account\/{accountId}\/domain\/{hostName}\/https\nwith the following body payload:\n{ \u0026quot;public_certificates\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;private_key\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;string\u0026quot; }  Server Name Indication Parts of the Section platform are using shared infrastructure. One component important in this context is the TLS Offload Proxy, implicit in all Proxy Stacks. Its role is to accept end-user HTTP and HTTPS connections for multiple web applications on multiple domains, handle any TLS handshake and then route requests to the correct Proxy Stack.\nFor non-HTTPS requests, routing is easily performed by parsing the Host header present in any standard HTTP\/1.1 request. For HTTPS it is a little more complicated.\nTraditionally during an SSL\/TLS handshake, the server provides its certificate (containing the domain names) to the client before the client has indicated which domain (or Host) its request is intended for.\nThankfully TLS has since introduced the Server Name Indication SNI extension which provides a mechanism for the client to specify the intended Host of its request before the server responds with its certificate. SNI allows the TLS Offload Proxy in Section to select the correct certificate to supply to the client and then continue routing the request to the correct Proxy Stack just as per a plain HTTP request.\nWhen a certificate is provided in an application’s section.config.json file it is being used for HTTPS requests from SNI-enabled clients only. Some clients, eg old mobile browsers and most Windows XP browsers, do not support SNI and will not be able provide the necessary information for Section to offer the correct certificate for HTTPS requests.\nBy default these clients will receive a fall-back certificate which is not valid for the Host their request is intended for and these clients will report a security error. If you need to support older non-SNI-capable clients, contact Section support to discuss adding your application’s Host name to the fall-back certificate.\n</p><p>https,</p><p>SSL,</p><p>TLS,</p><p>Let\u0027s</p><p>Encrypt,</p><p>EV,</p><p>Extended</p><p>Validation,</p><p>SNI,</p><p>Server</p><p>Name</p><p>Indication,</p><p>website</p><p>security,</p><p>content</p><p>delivery</p><p>network,</p><p>CDN</p>",

Below are the following steps you will need to take to get your Node.js app up and running within your Section application.\nStep 1: Add Node.js module to Section application Pull your Section application repository to your local machine. In the root of your repository, add a directory titled nodejs. Then edit section.config.json file in the root directory and insert the following object into the proxychain object located in the json file. This can be inserted at the index you prefer:\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;nodejs\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;image\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;nodejs:10.11.0\u0026quot; } Step 2: Define URL paths to be served by the Node.js module. Create a new file under the nodejs directory named server.conf. This is an Nginx configuration file where you can configure location blocks to route traffic to either the Node.js process or the next module in your proxy stack.\nTo route traffic to your Node.js process you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use the following Nginx configuration in the location block.\nlocation \/examplePath1\/ { proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $http_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $http_x_forwarded_proto; proxy_set_header Host $host; # This sends the request to the local Node.js server. include \/etc\/nginx\/section.module\/node.conf; } For all requests to be routed to the Node.js process, you can replace location \/examplePath\/ with location \/\nIf you would like to bypass the Node.js process for certain URL paths, use the Nginx configuration location block:\nlocation ~ \u0026quot;\/examplePath2\/\u0026quot; { proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $http_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $http_x_forwarded_proto; proxy_set_header Host $host; # This sends the request to the upstream module or origin web server. proxy_pass http:\/\/next-hop; } Step 3: Setting up your Node.js app Your Node.js application will live entirely in the nodejs directory and needs to satisfy the following requirements:\n Node.js Contract  Check out an example Nuxt application that will work out of the box with Section Node.js module.\nStep 4: Deploy to the Edge Commit all your changes to your Section repository and desired branch\/environment to trigger the deployment process.

							value: "Set up Outage Pages",
							label: "<p>A guide to setup custom outage pages Section has an Outage Page feature that will allow multiple HTML pages to be uploaded on to the platform and displayed during maintenance or other planned down times.\n1) Design an outage page The Outage Page feature is designed for HTML only. We recommend keeping the HTML simple. Any static assets linked in the HTML should be hosted off domain, such as on AWS S3.\n2) Upload an outage page You can place one or more HTML files in the outage_pages folder in your application repository. If this folder does not exist, you can create it. Each HTML file that is uploaded in to the repo will show up under the Outage Page portal page which you will find on the left hand side nav bar.\nFor example, if you uploaded the following 3 files into the outage_pages folder:\n  You should see them displayed in the Outage Page portal as per the screenshot.\n  3) Enable\/disable outage page When you wish to enable outage mode and display one of your uploaded outpage pages, simply check the box next to the page you wish to display and click \u0026ldquo;Engage\u0026rdquo;. You will be prompted to confirm the action. Once confirmed, all requests to the site will be served the outage page. Please be aware that a deployment time of around 30 seconds is expected when you click confirm.\nWhen you are ready for users to see the site again, click the Disengage button.\n4) Outage page for specific Domains or URLs Right now the Outage Page portal covers all domains and URLs on a Section environment.

This enables you to see how your own visitors are experiencing your website performance with the use of a simple JavaScript snippet. Data includes:\n Back end, front end, and full page load time Throughput Traffic by user agent (browser, device type)  Setting up RUM in Section To add RUM to your website, simply login to your Section account and go to \u0026ldquo;Real User Monitoring\u0026rdquo; under \u0026ldquo;Set Up\u0026rdquo; in the left navigation. All you need to do is paste the script tag above your \u0026lt;\/head\u0026gt; tag in any HTML document you want to track.\nAdding with Google Tag Manager To add the Section RUM script within Google Tag Manager, please follow the steps below:\n  Get the RUM script from your Section account and go to \u0026ldquo;Real User Monitoring\u0026rdquo; under \u0026ldquo;Set Up\u0026rdquo; in the left navigation.\n  Login to your Google Tag Manager account and navigate to the container with your domain you wish to add the script to.\n  Click on the red New Tag button.\n     Name the tag “Section RUM”.\n  Under Tag Configuration choose custom HTML.\n  Paste the RUM script into the area that appears.\n  Under Triggering choose All Pages. Click save.\n     In the upper right-hand corner, click Publish and continue to publish all changes.\n  Once you\u0026rsquo;ve completed these steps, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to start collecting performance metrics.\n  Set up RUM with Classifications Section RUM can also provide user statistics subdivided by page classifications, giving you pageload statistics for specific page classifications and site-wide statistics.\nTo setup RUM with page classifications: 1) Decide what classifications you want In order to build out the rest of your RUM script, you need to decide what page classifications you want to collect data for. Our available classifications are: Home,Product, Checkout, Category, and Uncategorised.\nNote: Make sure you do not change the spelling of \u0026lsquo;Uncategorised\u0026rsquo;. It will not collect the data\nIf you choose to enable them all, these classifications give you statistical metrics on your home page, your individual product pages, your product category pages, and your checkout process. Uncategorised collects metrics on everything that doesn\u0026rsquo;t fall into one of those classifications.\n2) Add HTML body classnames for each one of your classifications By the end of this step, all the pages you want tracked need to have a classification-specific class on their HTML body that identifies them to our RUM script. For example, all Product pages need to have some product class, all Category pages need to have a category class, etc.\nIf you are setting up RUM for a Magento application, you probably already have body classes you can use for this. These classnames are included below in the example code for Step #5. If you are using Magento, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to verify that your bodies have these classes and then proceed to the next step.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not using Magento but already have classes that appear consistently on the bodies of your pages, feel free to use those and proceed to the next step as well.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have any consistently applied body classes, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make some. A good classname for your Product classification would be something like rum-product. All that matters is that it makes sense and consistently appears on all pages that you want under that classification. Add these to the appropriate pages.\n3) Create a folder in your repository (found under Advanced Configuration) named rum. Note: In order to do this, you will need to pull down your configuration repository onto your local machine. Folders and files cannot be created in the UI.\n4) Create a JavaScript file inside rum with the same name as your Hostname\/Production domain name. If your Production domain name is www.example.com, then your JS file should be www.example.com.js. Similarly, if you are using a bare domain such as abc.com, then your JS file should be named abc.com.js.\n5) Tailor this template to fit your classifications and insert into your JS file: (function (w) { var pageUrl = w.location.pathname; var pageName = \u0026quot;Uncategorised\u0026quot;; if (bodyHasClass(\u0026quot;cms-home\u0026quot;)) { pageName = \u0026quot;Home\u0026quot;; } else if (bodyHasClass(\u0026quot;catalog-category-view\u0026quot;)) { pageName = \u0026quot;Category\u0026quot;; } else if (pageUrl.match(\u0026quot;\/checkout\u0026quot;)) { pageName = \u0026quot;Checkout\u0026quot;; } else if (bodyHasClass(\u0026quot;catalog-product-view\u0026quot;)) { pageName = \u0026quot;Product\u0026quot;; } else { pageName = \u0026quot;Uncategorised\u0026quot;; } w.sq_pagetype_override = pageName ; function bodyHasClass(className) { return document.getElementsByTagName(\u0026quot;BODY\u0026quot;)[0].classList.contains(className); } })(window); Double Note: Don\u0026rsquo;t change the spelling of Uncategorised\nThe only sections you should need to configure are the if-statements. The pageName variable will default to Uncategorised, but that default is overwritten if any if-statement resolves to true. The bodyHasClass() method will inspect the body for a given class and return a boolean, but you\u0026rsquo;re free to make the if-logic pass in any other way that makes sense. In the example above, Checkout pages are identified by URL matching as opposed to HTML classnames. What matters is that pageName is set to the right value.\n6) Contact Section In order to go-live with your new RUM, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a Section engineer. Email us at support@section.io.\nViewing your metrics To view your real user monitoring metrics login to your Section account and go to \u0026ldquo;Monitoring\u0026rdquo; under \u0026ldquo;Real time\u0026rdquo; in the left navigation.

Requests served from the section will always have a section-io-id response header. Please note that if you have not uploaded an SSL certificate for the site on to our platform and try to navigate to a HTTPS page, your browser will display a warning about an insecure site, this is expected and not a problem for testing. You can by-pass this warning in Chrome by clicking Advanced then Proceed to site. The warning will disappear once you have either uploaded a custom SSL certificate or after you have pointed DNS at our platform and have provisioned our free SSL certificate.\n  If this header isn\u0026rsquo;t present, check that the HOST file is correctly edited and saved. You may also need to flush the DNS cache of the browser. For Chrome enter the following in the address bar: chrome:\/\/net-internals\/#dns then clear the host cache.\nIf you still do not see a section-io-id, contact our support team through which ever channel is available to your support plan.\nWe recommend focusing on functional testing of the site, such as user login, add to cart, checkout etc.\nPerformance testing when the site is not live on our platform can yield varying results due to the cache being cold from lack of real world traffic.

							value: "Troubleshoot Developer PoP Issues",
							label: "<p>The Developer PoP is a still in beta and will occasionally have hiccups. This section details some common issues and how to deal with them.\nNetwork connectivity and computer sleep Often if you put your computer to sleep with Minikube running, it will break Minikube\u0026rsquo;s network adaptor, and you will get 503 errors without a clear cause when you resume operation. This will also prevent you from downloading proxy images as a part of a git push. In order to re-establish connectivity, you need to disconnect the network adapter and reconnect it. If using VirtualBox, do this by opening the VirtualBox UI, going to your VM\u0026rsquo;s settings, clicking network and then changing the attached to: value from NAT to not attached, and then back to NAT. Toggling this will reset the adapter.\nProblems with pods in a namespace Sometimes Minikube can fail at the namespace level — either by not properly provisioning all the containers it should, or failing to update existing containers after a new git push, or something else. If this happens, you can delete the namespace from the DevPop UI and push the repository back into Minikube by running git push developer-pop once the deleted namespace has disappeared from the DevPop UI. You can also accomplish this by renaming the git remote and initiating a git push developer-pop. This will create a new namespace and re-trigger all of the container provisioning.\nMinikube becomes unresponsive, or has other problems Sometimes, Minikube becomes unstable and stops responding to requests altogether. In this case, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to begin this whole process over again with a minikube delete and a minikube start. Note that sometimes (especially if you start Minikube again very quickly after the initial delete), Minikube will spin up on another IP address (say 192.168.99.101 instead of 192.168.99.100). This is fine, but you\u0026rsquo;ll need to adjust your hostfile and your git remote if this occurs. Alternatively, if you restart your computer and then start Minikube again, it will return to the 193.168.99.100 address. Most Minikube problems not caused by some sort of configuration error can be fixed with a fresh boot of Minikube, so give this a shot if the source of the problem is unclear.\n</p><p>content</p><p>delivery</p><p>network,</p><p>CDN,</p><p>virtual</p><p>machine,</p><p>vagrant,</p><p>virtualbox,</p><p>git,</p><p>cli,</p><p>local</p><p>development,</p><p>developer</p><p>pop</p>",

The certificates should be PEM encoded and will look like this in a text editor:\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\/* contents of domain certificate *\/\r-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\/* contents of intermediate certificate *\/\r-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r If there are more than one intermediate certificate, you will need to make sure they are copied in correct order.\n-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\/* contents of domain certificate *\/\r-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\/* contents of intermediate certificate 1*\/\r-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\r\/* contents of intermediate certificate 2*\/\r-----END CERTIFICATE-----\r Now copy and paste your private key in to the \u0026ldquo;Private key\u0026rdquo; input area. the private key should look like:\n-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\r\/* contents of private key *\/\r-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\r 4) Upload Once you have copy and pasted the certificates and private key, click the \u0026ldquo;Save Changes\u0026rdquo; button. The portal will perform a check to make sure the certificate is for the correct domain, and the private key is a match for the certificate. Once that is accepted, a deployment is made to the Section platform and you should see the new certificate on the site in moments. You will also see the uploaded certificate information at the right hand side of the HTTPS page.\nYou can also check your newly uploaded certificate using either a command line or 3rd party online tool.

							value: "Use Section hosted DNS",
							label: "<p>To simplify management for your websites, Section can provide DNS hosting. This is especially useful for pointing a zone-apex record (ie bare domain) at a Section endpoint if your current DNS hosting provider does not support the ALIAS or ANAME record types.\nHosting your DNS with Section also provides convenient access to DNS management within the Aperture portal.\nBegin hosting DNS with Section To enable Hosted DNS with Section:\n  Navigate to the DNS page for your Section application\u0026rsquo;s hosted environment (eg Production).\n  Below the \u0026ldquo;Change your DNS to go live\u0026rdquo; heading you should find another heading labeled \u0026ldquo;Section Hosted DNS\u0026rdquo;. The paragraph that follows will describe the DNS zone name that we have detected that your domain belongs to. If we have detected this zone correctly, and you have access to your DNS registrar to change the name servers for this zone, you can proceed.\n  Please note: Although DNS hosting and DNS registration are often thought of as the same thing and many companies offer both services, they are distinct and can be provided by different companies. The majority of the DNS record changes described in our DNS documentation (making CNAME or ALIAS changes for example) happen in your DNS hosting console, but changing your name servers must be done with your DNS Registrar.\nYour DNS registrar is the organization from which you purchased your actual domain name, not necessarily where your records are maintained and hosted — although again these often go together in practice. Your DNS registrar is the authority on what DNS servers are allowed to answer DNS queries for your website. Inputting Section nameservers into your DNS registrar gives us permission to respond to DNS queries for your site. Note as well that it is possible to enable the Section DNS zone and check to make sure all the records are correct before you change nameservers. We can provision a DNS zone before this change is made but not answer queries.\n Click the Enable Hosted DNS button. The DNS page will refresh after a few moments with new instructions.\n  For your convenience, our system will at this point attempt to copy the most common DNS records from your existing DNS hosting provider into our database, but it can miss some records. Follow the link in \u0026ldquo;Step 1\u0026rdquo; of the new DNS page to view the records that have been copied. Verify that the existing records are correct and add any missing records.\n  When you have verified and corrected the copied records, return the the DNS page for your Section application\u0026rsquo;s environment. \u0026ldquo;Step 2\u0026rdquo; on this page lists the new name servers that you will need to enter for your zone at your DNS registrar. Once this is done the change may take up to 48 hours to propagate to all DNS servers globally — after that you can manage your DNS records via Section and your old DNS hosting provider is not used. You will want to wait the full 48 hours and check DNS propagation globally before you turn off your old DNS hosting.\n  Click the Verify button on the DNS page to test if HTTP requests for your site are reaching the Section endpoints.\n  Once you have changed your DNS, please ensure you\u0026rsquo;ve setup HTTPS.\nManage your DNS hosted with Section Once Hosted DNS has been enabled for a Section application you can access the zone management page in two ways:\n From the DNS page of a hosted environment (Step 1 links to the zone page) or \u0026hellip; On the left hand navigation bar under Account click DNS Hosting.  From the zone page for a particular zone you can view:\n The name servers that should be configured at your DNS registrar. The table of DNS records defined in the zone.  From the records table you can:\n Delete records that are not associated with a Section site. Upon first click of the Delete button beside the target record, the button label will change to Confirm, upon clicking again the record will be deleted and begin propagating immediately. Add new records by clicking the Add button at the bottom of the table, filling the required fields, then clicking the Save button. You cannot create a CNAME record at the zone apex, use an ALIAS record instead for this purpose. Edit existing records by clicking the corresponding Edit button. The record types A, ALIAS, or CNAME can be changed to another record type in this same set and when saved the change will be applied so the record does not appear missing during the transition.  </p><p>DNS,</p><p>DNS</p><p>records,</p><p>DNS</p><p>hosting,</p><p>bare</p><p>domain,</p><p>zone</p><p>apex,</p><p>naked</p><p>domain</p><p>and</p><p>root</p><p>domain</p>",

Check out our guide on Advanced Configuration for more advanced configuration topics.\nVarnish To make getting your CDN setup easier we have a number of configuration options you can enable without having to know how to use Varnish\u0026rsquo;s VCL programming language. To use these go to the Proxy page under the Configuration menu in Aperture. To use these features the following line needs to be in your default.vcl file under the backend declaration (it will be there by default). Note, these basic options work for VCL 4.0 only.\ninclude \u0026quot;section-features.vcl\u0026quot;;  There are the following configuration options\nGeneral Settings These apply to all requests no matter what (if any) file extension they have\n Sort Querystring: Often the order of querystring parameters change especially things like ad tracking parameters. This option sorts every url\u0026rsquo;s querystring parameters into alphabetical order so that they are always the same, improving your cache hit ratio.  Static Caching These options apply only to static files, that is, files with the following file extensions: css, js, jp(e)g, png, gif, ico \u0026amp; swf.\n  Cache Statics TTL: Setting this to something other than Retain origin setting will cause us to cache all static resources for the length of time specified. By selecting Retain origin setting we will only cache files that have the appropriate cache-control response header sent from the origin.\n  Remove Querystring: If someone requests a static file from your site with a querystring this will result in a cache miss if no one has requested that exact URL before. By switching this option on we will remove all querystring parameters before caching the object. Don\u0026rsquo;t enable this if querystrings are needed to load static content correctly.\n  Browser Cache TTL: Specifies how long your visitors\u0027 browsers will cache files using the cache-control response header sent to their browsers. By selecting Retain origin setting we will not change the cache-control header and will simply pass through what your origin server sends.\n  Changes made to these options will be reflected in the proxy-features.json file in the proxy folder in your application git repository so you can see when options were changed. You can view the VCL that is generated by these options on the Generated VCL tab.\nTo start writing your own VCL, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to head over to the repo.\nModsecurity To make getting your CDN setup easier we have a number of configuration options you can enable without writing any code. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined rules that you can view by going to the Proxy page under the Configuration menu in Aperture. If you have both Varnish Cache and Modsecurity setup, you will need to click Proxy in the top nav to display a drop down menu to view both of your reverse proxies and select Modsecurity.\nThe initial configuration in a repository starts ModSecurity’s SecRuleEngine in DetectionOnly mode (this writes log entries but never executes any disruptive actions). This is a great starting point, as you can immediately see possible threats without stopping legitimate traffic to your site.\nFor each config file that we\u0026rsquo;ve setup you can see a list of rules within that file and an on\/off toggle. Turning the toggle \u0026ldquo;On\u0026rdquo; will allow the rules to start actively detecting traffic for that rule. In order to turn the rules into a blocking mode, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to do advanced configuration by editing files in the repo. To learn more about what each rule does, visit OWASP Modsecurity Rule Set Project.\n</p><p>website</p><p>performance,</p><p>page</p><p>speed,</p><p>webpage</p><p>speed,</p><p>website</p><p>security,</p><p>varnish,</p><p>VCL,</p><p>modsecurity,</p><p>CDN</p><p>configuration</p>",

							value: "Varnish Cache Quick Config",
							label: "<p>Learning VCL can be a tricky thing so we have made a GUI that let\u0026rsquo;s you cache your static assets and HTML documents without knowing VCL.\nIn the left hand side of your Aperture dashboard there is a section called Quick Config which contains the toggles and inputs to configure Varnish Cache.\n  Varnish Cache Quick Config   Configure static asset caching Static asset caching is enabled by default to cache your statics for 6 hours and retain your origin cache control headers for the browser cache. Below is a list of file extensions that we cache by default:\n css js jpeg png gif ico swf woff  There are 3 settings for static caching as well the first is the TTL (Time to Live) which tells Varnish Cache how long to cache your static assets for, the second is a toggle to remove the query strings for all static assets to increase your cache hit rate, and the third is a setting to set the cache-control header for browser caching.\nNote: be careful with the browser cache setting as it becomes difficult to invalidate the browser cache if you don\u0026rsquo;t have some type of version control for your static assets.\nConfigure HTML caching The first thing you\u0026rsquo;ll notice is a toggle to enable and disable HTML caching for quick and easy incident management in the case of an emergency.\nWhen HTML caching is enabled it will by default cache all of your HTML documents that are fetched with a GET request. This is great for sites that are completely static and do not have any customized or authenticated sections or content, for example a shopping cart or customized nav bar per authenticated user.\nIn order to configure your site for a pattern we like to call ISE (Intelligent Session Establishment) you\u0026rsquo;ll need to have a basic understand of Regexes and how your application establishes a session with a Cookie.\nThe first option you\u0026rsquo;ll need to configure are the routes you never want to be cached like admin routes or cart routes. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to construct a Regex that matches on all of your non-cacheable routes. Here is an example:\n(\/admin|\/cart|\/user) So this pattern will match the following routes and not cache them (these are all examples of routes that will not be cached):\n \/admin \/admin\/test.html \/test\/admin\/abc\/123.html \/cart \/cart\/checkout \/user\/1  The second option you\u0026rsquo;ll need to configure is the Cookie(s) that identify a users session. This is usually established when a user adds something to their cart, logs in tho their account, etc. These cookies are generally set on a POST request which forces the user out of the caching behavior. This is also configured with a Regex in case you have multiple cookies that establish a user\u0026rsquo;s sessions.\n(frontend|logged_in_user) Note: Only HTTP GET requests will be cached with this pattern.\n</p>",

							value: "View response metrics by region",

You will be utilizing the Kibana\/HTTP Logs view to break down the time_taken_ms field on the edge-access-log type by the geoip.country_code2 field.\nStep 1 - Creating the visualization  Visit your Section portal and view the HTTP Logs section of your application. This will open up the Kibana view in it\u0026rsquo;s default state. Proceed to click the visualize tab in the upper nav bar which will prompt you to Create a visualization. Select the Line Chart option followed by From a new search.  The Kibana view can be opened up in a new tab by clicking the \u0026ldquo;Open in a new window\u0026rdquo; button. This is useful if you wish to share the visualization with a colleague.\n Step 2 - The search term You should be viewing a line chart with a single data point and the term \u0026ldquo;*\u0026rdquo; in the search input. For this visualization we will want to only view the edge-access-log. Copy and paste the following into the search box to view only the edge logs:\n_type:edge-access-log\nStep 3 - Defining the X-Axis You will now configure the X-Axis to display the data over a period of time.\n On the left hand side of the screen you will want to select X-Axis under the Select buckets type drop down. Select Date Histogram as the Aggregation. Hit the green play button to view the results.  At this time you are viewing the total number of edge-access-logs (Count metric) over a period of time.\n Step 4 - Defining the Y-Axis You will now configure the Y-Axis to display the average time taken in milliseconds for the edge logs.\n On the left hand side of the screen you will want to select Y-Axis under the metrics section.  The Y-Axis is already configured to show the Count metric as we previously saw while defining the X-Axis.   Configure the Aggregation to show the Average value instead of Count and this will prompt you to select a field. Here we will find the time_taken_ms option to select. Hit the green play button again to view the results of the average time_taken_ms for ALL edge logs.  Step 5 - Splitting the lines You are now viewing the average time_taken_ms value over your selected time frame for all edge logs. Next steps will be to split the lines by country code.\n On the left hand nav under the X-Axis configuration click the Add sub-buckets option. Select the Split Lines option which will add a second layer to the X-Axis. In the Sub Aggregation option box select the terms option. This will prompt you to select another field, this time you will select the geoip.country_code2 field. Above the Sub Aggregation select box, there is an arrow which allows you to make this aggregation the main aggregate. Select the up arrow. Hit the green play button again to view the results of the average time_taken_ms for edge logs broken down by the top 5 country codes during your selected time frame.  Additional notes You can include more than the default 5 results by increasing the Size option under the geoip.country_code2 aggregate configuration.\n If you are interested in a select few country codes, then you can append search terms to your global search. For example:\n_type:edge-access-log AND (geoip.country_code2:US OR geoip.country_code2:AU)\n </p><p>webpage</p><p>test,</p><p>testing,</p><p>speed,</p><p>regions</p>",
