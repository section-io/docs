## Overview

Optidash module allows the flexibility to control the quality of the optimized image.

## How To

You can control the optimized image quality by changing the following settings in the [advanced configuration](/docs/modules/optidash/reference/optidash-advanced-config/) settings for Optidash :

- `"lossless" : "true/false"`

Enable disable lossy compression.

- `"quality" : 1 - 100`

 This options will only be used if the LOSSY option is set to true. Can be a number in the range of 1 - 100. If the quality option is not provided it will default to "auto" where Optidash will optimize the images based on their characteristics.
