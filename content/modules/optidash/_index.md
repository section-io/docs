## What does it do

Use Optidash.ai to optimize images and reduce page weight and load time.

Deploying the Optidash edge module on Sectionâ€™s Edge Compute Platform means you will immediately have access to Optidash and the advanced image optimization features including:

- Reduce page weight without sacrificing image quality
- Speed up page delivery
- Take workload off the marketing department and let Optidash.ai manage image size and quality
- Optimize browser rendering

Image optimization for the web is one of the most important elements of delivering faster pages. Having large image files or a high number of individual images can significantly impact load times, and unrendered images result in poor user experience. 

Optidash optimizes all common image file types by compressing them so that visitors receive images that work best with their device type and browser. 

Optidash also resizes images on the fly.

To see how Optidash can reduce image sizes by 50% or more, visit the [Optidash API docs](https://docs.optidash.ai/introduction).
