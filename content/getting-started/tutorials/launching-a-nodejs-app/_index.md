This tutorial will get your [Node.js]({{< ref "modules/nodejs/_index.md" >}}) app running on Section's edge compute platform.

At the end of this tutorial you will have:

* A website running as a subdomain at `section.dev`
* Free and automatically renewing SSL certificates for your website
* Used the `sectionctl` CLI tool to deploy changes to your app

Let's start by [setting up `sectionctl`, the Section CLI tool]({{< relref "getting-started/tutorials/launching-a-nodejs-app/set-up-sectionctl.md" >}}).
