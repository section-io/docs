## Introduction
Section allows you to create API Tokens that belongs to your user. 
API Tokens have the same permissions as your account. 
When your user account is deleted, these key will persist.

## Creating an API Token

Go to the [User Setting page](https://aperture.section.io/new/configure/user) by clicking on your profile picture in the top right then select [API Tokens](https://aperture.section.io/new/configure/user/tokens):

![Create API Token](/docs/images/api-token-create.png)

Enter a description for what this API Token will be used for, and then click the *Add* button:

![Create API Token Result](/docs/images/api-token-create-after.png)

Copy the token value and store it somewhere securely. 
As the warning says, this value cannot be retrieved later. 
If you loose this value you will need to create a new token and delete the old one.

The API Tokens you have created will be listed on this page.
They can be deleted by clicking the *X* button next to the Token description.
